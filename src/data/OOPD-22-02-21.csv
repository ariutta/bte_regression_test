Aromatase (exemestane) is the principal enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens both in pre- and postmenopausal women. While the main source of estrogen (primarily estradiol) is the ovary in premenopausal women, the principal source of circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women is from conversion of adrenal and ovarian androgens (androstenedione and testosterone) to estrogens (estrone and estradiol) by the aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues. Estrogen deprivation through aromatase inhibition is an effective and selective treatment for some postmenopausal patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer. Exemestane is an irreversible, steroidal aromatase inactivator, structurally related to the natural substrate androstenedione. It irreversibly binds to the active site causing permanent inhibition necessitating de novo synthesis to restore enzymatic function. Exemestane significantly lowers circulating estrogen concentrations in postmenopausal women, but has no detectable effect on the adrenal biosynthesis of corticosteroids or aldosterone.

However, with continuous daily administration, nafarelin continuously occupies the GnRH receptor, leading to a reversible down-regulation of the GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland and desensitization of the pituitary gonadotropes. This causes a significant and sustained decline in the production of LH and FSH. A decline in gonadotropin production and release causes a dramatic reversible decrease in synthesis of estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone by the ovaries or testes. Like normal endometrium, endometriotic implants contain estrogen receptors. Estrogen stimulates the growth of endometrium. Use of nafarelin induces anovulation and amenorrhea and decreases serum concentrations of estradiol to the postmenopausal range, which induces atrophy of endometriotic implants. However, nafarelin does not abolish the underlying pathophysiology of endometriosis. In children with central precocious puberty receiving nafarelin, serum LH, testosterone, and estradiol concentrations return to prepubertal levels. This results in the supression of secondary sexual characteristics and decrased rate of linear growth and skeletal maturation.

This is because, as a form of prostaglandinE1 (PGE1) it has multiple effects on blood flow. This results in increased pulmonary or systemic blood flow in infants. In cyanotic congenital heart disease, alprostadil's actions result in an increased oxygen supply to the tissues. In infants with interrupted aortic arch or very severe aortic coarctation, alprostadil maintains distal aortic perfusion by permitting blood flow through the DA from the pulmonary artery to the aorta. In infants with aortic coarctation, alprostadil reduces aortic obstruction either by relaxing ductus tissue in the aortic wall or by increasing effective aortic diameter by dilating the DA. In infants with these aortic arch anomalies, systemic blood flow to the lower body is increased, improving tissue oxygen supply and renal perfusion. When administered by intracavernosal injection or as an intraurethral suppository, alprostadil acts locally to relax the trabecular smooth muscle of the corpora cavernosa and the cavernosal arteries. Swelling, elongation, and rigidity of the penis result when arterial blood rapidly flows into the corpus cavernosum to expand the lacunar spaces.

This inhibition results in a halt in production of ergosterol, a molecule typically found in the membranes of fungi such as Aspergillus, Candida, and Mucorales that plays a role in regulation of membrane integrity, fluidity and permeability. The inhibition of Erg11p also causes the buildup of ergosterol precursors, which are toxic and cause cell death. |Isavuconazole displays fungicidal actions by disrupting the biosynthesis of ergosterol, which is a key component of fungal cell membrane. It inhibits cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase that mediates the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. The side arm of of the active isavuconazole molecule allows for greater affinity for the binding pocket in the fungal CYP51 protein by orienting the triazole ring of the molecule to engage with the heme moiety at the bottom of the binding pocket [A32026, A32029]. This explains the wide antifungal spectrum of isavuconazole and possible cross-resistance to other triazoles [A32026, A32029]. As a result of lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase inhibition, toxic methylated sterol precursors such as 14-α-methylated lanosterol, 4,14-dimethylzymosterol, and 24-methylenedihydrolanosterol alter the function of fungal membrane and accumulate within the fungal cytoplasm [A32029]. Depletion of ergosterol within the fungal cell membrane leads to decreased structural integrity and function of the cell membrane, inhibited fungal cell growth and replication [A32026], and ultimately cell death. Mammalian cell demethylation is less sensitive to isavuconazole inhibition [FDA Label].%0A%0AMechanism of resistance and reduced susceptibility to isavuconazole arises from mutations in the fungal cyp51A and cyp51B genes coding for the target protein lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase [L1482]. Other multiple mechanisms leading to resistance, including changes in sterol profile and elevated efflux pump activity of fungal species, cannot be excluded [FDA Label].",CYP3A4,cytochrome P450 inhibitor

It contains two src homology 2 (SH2) domains separated by a linker domain. These SH2 domains bind to tyrosine residues on the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motif phosphorylated by Lyn, another kinase in the cascade. This motif is located on the cytoplasmic regions of several immune receptors including Fc receptors, TCRs, BCRs, and natural killer cell receptors. The flexibility provided by the linker enables the protein to bind to many receptor types. Inhibition of Syk suppresses downstream signal transduction [A32899].%0A%0AWhile Syk plays a role in some pathways involved in the generation of the oxidative burst by neutrophils or phagocytosis by macrophages, R406 does not have a significant effect on these processes [A32899].

However, it is known that CBD acts on cannabinoid (CB) receptors of the endocannabinoid system, which are found in numerous areas of the body, including the peripheral and central nervous systems, including the brain. The endocannabinoid system regulates many physiological responses of the body including pain, memory, appetite, and mood. More specifically, CB1 receptors can be found within the pain pathways of the brain and spinal cord where they may affect CBD-induced analgesia and anxiolysis, and CB2 receptors have an effect on immune cells, where they may affect CBD-induced anti-inflammatory processes. %0A%0ACBD has been shown to act as a negative allosteric modulator of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, the most abundant G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) in the body [A32469]. Allosteric regulation of a receptor is achieved through the modulation of the activity of a receptor on a functionally distinct site from the agonist or antagonist binding site. The negative allosteric modulatory effects of CBD are therapeutically important as direct agonists are limited by their psychomimetic effects while direct antagonists are limited by their depressant effects [A32469].

This metabolite is responsible for essentially all of the drug's activity in-vivo. The mechanism of action of leflunomide has not been fully determined, but appears to primarily involve regulation of autoimmune lymphocytes. It has been suggested that leflunomide exerts its immunomodulating effects by preventing the expansion of activated autoimmune lymphocytes via interferences with cell cycle progression. In-vitro data indicates that leflunomide interferes with cell cycle progression by inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (a mitochondrial enzyme involved in de novo pyrimidine ribonucleotide uridine monophosphate (rUMP)synthesis) and has antiproliferative activity. Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase consists of 2 domains: an α/β-barrel domain containing the active site and an α-helical domain that forms a tunnel leading to the active site. A77 1726 binds to the hydrophobic tunnel at a site near the flavin mononucleotide. Inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase by A77 1726 prevents production of rUMP by the de novo pathway; such inhibition leads to decreased rUMP levels, decreased DNA and RNA synthesis, inhibition of cell proliferation, and G1 cell cycle arrest. It is through this action that leflunomide inhibits autoimmune T-cell proliferation and production of autoantibodies by B cells. Since salvage pathways are expected to sustain cells arrested in the G1 phase, the activity of leflunomide is cytostatic rather than cytotoxic. Other effects that result from reduced rUMP levels include interference with adhesion of activated lymphocytes to the synovial vascular endothelial cells, and increased synthesis of immunosuppressive cytokines such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Leflunomide is also a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tyrosine kinases activate signalling pathways leading to DNA repair, apoptosis and cell proliferation. Inhibition of tyrosine kinases can help to treating cancer by preventing repair of tumor cells. |The exact mechanism by which teriflunomide acts in MS is not known.

These metabolites are readily determined by measuring urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (17-OHCS) or 17-ketogenic steroids (17-KGS). Because of these actions, metopirone is used as a diagnostic test, with urinary 17-OHCS measured as an index of pituitary ACTH responsiveness.

Like other beta-lactam antibiotics, doripenem's bactericidal mechanism of action is mostly due to cell death after inhibition of bacterial enzymes called penicillin-bindng proteins (PBPs), which are responsible for peptidoglycan cross-linking during the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Carbapenems mainly have high affinity for PBPs 1a, 1b, 2 and 3. Inhibition of each PBP usually results in a different inactivating mechanism. Inhibition of PBPs 1a and 1b results in fast bacterial killing through the formation of spheroplasts, inhibition of PBP 2 results in rod-shaped bacteria to become spherical, and inhibition of PBP 3 results in filamentous-shaped organisms. The PBPs preferentially bound by different carbapenems depend on the organism. In E.coli and P.aeruginosa, doripenem binds to PBP%0A2, which is involved in the maintenance of cell shape, as well as to PBPs 3 and 4.

This paralysis is accompanied - and probably caused - by a rapid Ca 2+ influx inside the schistosome. Morphological alterations are another early effect of praziquantel. These morphological alterations are accompanied by an increased exposure of schistosome antigens at the parasite surface. The worms are then either completely destroyed in the intestine or passed in the stool. An interesting quirk of praziquantel is that it is relatively ineffective against juvenile schistosomes. While initially effective, effectiveness against schistosomes decreases until it reaches a minimum at 3-4 weeks. Effectiveness then increases again until it is once again fully effective at 6-7 weeks. Glutathione S-transferase (GST), an essential detoxification enzyme in parasitic helminths, is a major vaccine target and a drug target against schistosomiasis.

Regulators of cell cycle progression are also affected, namely p21, p27, galectin-3, and Tob. Inhibitor of NFκB also collects in the nucleus as a result leading to reduced activity of NFκB, a known contributor to cancer.[A180262,A180268] XPO1 participates in the formation of a complex with eukaryotic initiation factor 4E and contributes to the transport of messenger RNA for several oncegenes including cell cycle promotors, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and CDK2/4/6, as well as antiapoptotic proteins, Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL.[A180262] These wide ranging changes in protein expression and gene transcription culminate in cell cycle arrest and the promotion of apoptosis in cancer cells.%0A%0A",XPO1,exportin antagonist

It binds to GABA-A receptors containing any of the α, β, γ, or δ-subunits but displays strongest potency when bound to receptors containing α3 or δ subunits [A19742]. Stiripentol is an inhibitor of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which plays a physiological role in energy metabolism of neurons and regulation of neuronal excitation. It binds to the site separate from lactate and pyruvate binding sites of the enzyme and inhibits both pyruvate-to-lactate conversion and lactate-to-pyruvate conversion [A19741]. LDH inhibitors including stiripentol as antiepileptic treatments mimic ketogenic diet, where the energy source in the brain is switched from glucose to mainly ketone bodies. The ketone bodies directly regulate neuronal excitation and seizures via ATP-sensitive potassium channels and vesicular glutamate transporters [A19741]. As a potent inhibitor of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, mainly CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, stiripentol co-administration with other antiepileptic drugs elevates the free unchanged active drugs (such as carbamazepine, sodium valproate, phenytoin, phenobarbital and many benzodiazepines) in the circulation to mediate their therapeutic actions.

The activity of the phosphoinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway is also reduced by rhien [A19343]. Rhein's inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (particularly those involving extracellular signal regulated kinase) appears to follow a U-shaped dose response curve. ERK phosphorylation is inhibited at low concentrations of around 3microM but activated at higher concentrations of around 30microM [A19344]. Furthermore, ERK phosporylation is again inhibited at extremely high concentrations in excess of 100 microM [A19342]. The suppression of these three pathways is likely involved in the anti-proliferative effects of rhein.%0A%0A**Anti-inflammatory:** The mechanism of rhein's anti-inflammatory effect likely involves its inhibition of the NFkappa B pathway which plays a role in the production of many pro-inflammatory cytokines [A19342] [A19345]. Rhein's anti-oxidant activity may also play a role in preventing damage during inflammation.%0A%0A**Anti-diabetic:** Rhein is thought to increase islet beta cell survival by suppressing the expression of dynamin-related protein 1 and thereby preventing mitochondrial fission [A19288]. Rhein's anti-oxidant properties are also thought to play a role in protecting islet beta cells. The reduction in plasma glucose is likely due to increased survival of islet beta cells and subsequent increases in insulin secretion. Rhein's anti-inflammatory action may also serve to reduce insulin resistance.%0A%0A**Anti-microbial:** Rhien inhibits H. pylori arylamine N-acetyltransferase in a dose dependent manner [A19312]. The mechanism of rhein's anti-microbial effect on H. pylori and S. aureus are unknown.%0A%0A**Anti-allergenic:** Rhien inhibits 5-lipoxygenase with an IC50 of 13.7microM [A19329].

It binds to albumin and fibrinogen [A11831, A177685] preventing blood clot lysis by stomach acid (hydrochloric acid). Sucralfate increases the tissue levels of fibroblast growth factors and epidermal growth factors [A17638, A16741], leading to an increase in prostaglandins at the gastrointestinal tract lining, which promote the healing of gastrointestinal ulcers [A177655]. %0A%0AIn the laboratory setting, a sucralfate-albumin film provides a barrier against the entry of hydrogen ions, which are a component of gastric acid. In humans, sucralfate, given at therapeutic doses for ulcers, decreases pepsin activity in gastric fluids by 32% [FDA label].  Pepsin has been shown to be damaging to tissues, further aggravating ulcer lesion inflammation [A177667]. Bile salts have been implicated in mucosal injury to the gastrointestinal tract [A177697, A177700].

It is suggested that MTIC then alkylates DNA at the N7 position of guanine, O3 position of adenosine, and O6 position of guanosine, with the most common site being the N7 position. This methylation of guanine residues lead to single and double-strand DNA breaks and subsequent apoptotic cell death. It is suggested that the N7-methylguanine plays a critical role in the antitumor activity of the drug, as there is a correlation between the sensitivity of tumor cell lines to temozolomide and the activity of O6-alkylguanine alkyltransferase, which is the DNA repair protein that specifically removes alkyl groups at the O6 position of guanine. Cells lines that have lower levels of AGT are more sensitive to the cytotoxicity of temozolomide. It is also suggested that cytotoxic mechanism of temozolomide is related to the failure of the DNA MMR system to find a complementary base for methylated guanine. The DNA MMR system is involved in the formation of a number of proteins that remove methylated guanine. Evidence shows that when this repair process is targeted to the DNA strand opposite the O6-methylguanine, its inability to find the correct target leads to long-lived nicks in the DNA.

The endocannabinoid system regulates many physiological responses of the body including pain, memory, appetite, and mood. More specifically, CB1 receptors can be found within the pain pathways of the brain and spinal cord where they may affect CBD-induced analgesia and anxiolysis, and CB2 receptors have an effect on immune cells, where they may affect CBD-induced anti-inflammatory processes. %0A%0ACBD has been shown to act as a negative allosteric modulator of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, the most abundant G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) in the body [A32469].

The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].%0A%0AZinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].%0A%0AIn HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].%0A%0AThere are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].%0A%0AZinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A342417].%0A%0AThe change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A3424]. %0A%0AIn humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].%0A%0AIn another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A3424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway.

It is classified as a nucleoside analog DNA polymerase enzyme inhibitor. Aciclovir is a purine (guanine) nucleoside analog is a metabolite that heavily contributes to the pharmacological actions of valacyclovir. In fact, most of valacyclovir's activity is attributed to  acyclovir [A175885].%0A%0AValacyclovir is rapidly and almost completely converted in man to aciclovir and valine, likely by the enzyme _valacyclovir hydrolase_.%0AAciclovir is a selective inhibitor of the herpes viruses, possessing in vitro activity against herpes simplex viruses (HSV) type 1 and type 2, varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), as well as human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6). Aciclovir has been shown to inhibit herpes virus DNA synthesis after it has been phosphorylated to the active triphosphate form [F3949].%0A%0AThe first stage of drug phosphorylation for acyclovir requires activation by a virus-specific enzyme. In the case of HSV, VZV and EBV this enzyme is the viral _thymidine kinase_ (TK), which is only found in virus-infected cells.  The process of phosphorylation is completed (conversion from mono- to triphosphate) by cellular kinases. Acyclovir triphosphate competitively inhibits the virus DNA polymerase and incorporation of this agent results in DNA chain termination, stopping virus DNA synthesis and blocking virus replication [F3949]. The inhibitory capabilities of acyclovir are highly selective due to the drug's strong affinity for _thymidine kinase_ (TK)[FDA label].%0A%0A%0AIn summary, the antiviral effects of valacyclovir are achieved in 3 ways [FDA label]: %0A%0A1) competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase%0A%0A2) incorporation and termination of the growing viral DNA chain%0A%0A3) inactivation of the viral DNA polymerase. The higher level of antiviral activity of acyclovir against HSV compared with VZV is attributed to its more efficient phosphorylation by viral thymidine kinase (TK).|Acyclovir is becomes acyclovir monophosphate due to the action of viral thymidine kinase.[A180757] Acyclovir monophosphate is converted to the diphosphate form by guanylate kinase.[A903] Acyclovir diphosphate is converted to acyclovir triphosphate by nucleoside diphosphate kinase, pyruvate kinase, creatine kinase, phosphoglycerate kinase, succinyl-CoA synthetase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and adenylosuccinate synthetase.[A903,A180781] Acyclovir triphosphate has higher affinity for viral DNA polymerase than cellular DNA polymerase and incorporates into the DNA where the missing 2' and 3' carbons causes DNA chain termination.[A180757] In other cases acyclovir triphosphate competes so strongly for viral DNA polymerase that other bases cannot associate with the enzyme, inactivating it.[A180757]",PNP,DNA polymerase inhibitor

One probable mechanism is the inhibition of nucleotide phosphodiesterase enzymes, adenosine receptors, regulation of calcium handling in cells, and participates in adenosine receptor antagonism.[A187221,L9857] Phosphodiesterase enzymes regulate cell function via actions on second messengers cAMP and cGMP.[A187724] This causes lipolysis through activation of hormone-sensitive lipases, releasing fatty acids and glycerol.[T722]%0A%0A**Respiratory**%0A%0AThe exact mechanism of action of caffeine in treating apnea related to prematurity is unknown, however, there are several proposed mechanisms, including respiratory center stimulation in the central nervous system, a reduced threshold to hypercapnia with increased response, and increased consumption of oxygen, among others.[L9851] The blocking of the adenosine receptors enhances respiratory drive via an increase in brain medullary response to carbon dioxide, stimulating ventilation and respiratory drive, while increasing contractility of the diaphragm.[T716]%0A%0A**Central nervous system**%0A%0ACaffeine demonstrates antagonism of all 4 adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2a, A2b, A3) in the central nervous system.[T716,L9851] Caffeine's effects on alertness and combatting drowsiness are specifically related to the antagonism of the A2a receptor.[T716]%0A%0A**Renal system**%0A%0ACaffeine has diuretic effects due to is stimulatory effects on renal blood flow, increase in glomerular filtration, and increase in sodium excretion.[T716]%0A%0A**Cardiovascular system**%0A%0AAdenosine receptor antagonism at the A1 receptor by caffeine stimulates inotropic effects in the heart. Blocking of adenosine receptors promotes catecholamine release, leading to stimulatory effects occurring in the heart and the rest of the body.  In the blood vessels, caffeine exerts direct antagonism of adenosine receptors, causing vasodilation. It stimulates the endothelial cells in the blood vessel wall to release nitric oxide, potentiating blood vessel relaxation. Catecholamine release, however, antagonizes this and exerts inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart, ultimately leading to vasoconstriction. Finally, caffeine is shown to raise systolic blood pressure measurements by 5 to 10 mmHg when it is not taken regularly, versus no effect in those who consume it regularly.[T716] The vasoconstricting effects of caffeine are beneficial in migraines and other types of headache, which are normally caused by vasodilation in the brain.[A187709,L9872]",ADORA1|ADORA3|PDE11A|PDE10A|PDE8A|PDE8B|PDE9A|PDE6C|PDE6A|PDE6B|PDE7A|PDE7B|PDE4C|PDE4D|PDE4A|PDE4B|PDE5A|PDE2A|PDE3B|PDE3A|PDE1B|PDE1C|PDE1A|PRKDC|PIK3CD|PIK3CB|PIK3CA|ITPR3|ITPR2|ITPR1|RYR3|RYR1|RYR2|ATR|ATM|ADORA2B|ADORA2A,adenosine receptor antagonist%7Cphosphodiesterase inhibitor

Phosphatidylcholine's role in the maintenance of cell membrane integrity is vital to all of the basic biological processes: information flow, intracellular communication and bioenergetics. Inadequate choline intake would negatively affect all these processes. Choline is also a major part of another membrane phospholipid, sphingomyelin, also important for the maintenance of cell structure and function. It is noteworthy and not surprising that choline deficiency in cell culture causes apoptosis or programmed cell death. This appears to be due to abnormalities in cell membrane phosphatidylcholine content and an increase in ceramide, a precursor, as well as a metabolite, of sphingomyelin. Ceramide accumulation, which is caused by choline deficiency, appears to activate Caspase, a type of enzyme that mediates apoptosis. Betaine or trimethylglycine is derived from choline via an oxidation reaction. Betaine is one of the factors that maintains low levels of homocysteine by resynthesizing L-methionine from homocysteine. Elevated homocysteine levels are a significant risk factor for atherosclerosis, as well as other cardiovascular and neurological disorders.

Therefore BH4 is required for the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, for the production of epinephrine (adrenaline) and the synthesis of the monoamine neuro-transmitters, serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). It is also involved in apoptosis and other cellular events mediated by nitric oxide production. As a coenzyme, BH4 reacts with molecular oxygen to form an active oxygen intermediate that can hydroxylate substrates. In the hydroxylation process, the co-enzyme loses two electrons and is regenerated in vivo in an NADH-dependent reaction. As a co-factor for PAH, tetrahydrobiopterin allows the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine and reduces the level of phenylalanine in the bloodstream, thereby reducing the toxic effects of of this amino acid. Normal serum concentrations of phenylalanine are 100 micomolar, while elevated (toxic) levels are typically >1200 micromolar. Individuals with a deficiency in tetrahydrobiopterin are not able to efficiently convert phenylalanine to tyrosine. The excess levels provided by tetrahydrobiopterin supplementation help improve enzyme efficiency. As a co-factor for tyrosine hydroxylase, BH4 facilitates the conversion of tyrosine to L-dopa while as a co-factor for tryptophan hydroxylase, BH4 allows the conversion of tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan, which is then converted to serotonin.",NOS3|PAH|TPH1|DBH|TH,phenylalanine 4-hydroxylase stimulant

This inhibition results in a halt in production of ergosterol, a molecule typically found in the membranes of fungi such as Aspergillus, Candida, and Mucorales that plays a role in regulation of membrane integrity, fluidity and permeability. The inhibition of Erg11p also causes the buildup of ergosterol precursors, which are toxic and cause cell death. |Isavuconazole displays fungicidal actions by disrupting the biosynthesis of ergosterol, which is a key component of fungal cell membrane. It inhibits cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase that mediates the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. The side arm of of the active isavuconazole molecule allows for greater affinity for the binding pocket in the fungal CYP51 protein by orienting the triazole ring of the molecule to engage with the heme moiety at the bottom of the binding pocket [A32026, A32029]. This explains the wide antifungal spectrum of isavuconazole and possible cross-resistance to other triazoles [A32026, A32029]. As a result of lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase inhibition, toxic methylated sterol precursors such as 14-α-methylated lanosterol, 4,14-dimethylzymosterol, and 24-methylenedihydrolanosterol alter the function of fungal membrane and accumulate within the fungal cytoplasm [A32029]. Depletion of ergosterol within the fungal cell membrane leads to decreased structural integrity and function of the cell membrane, inhibited fungal cell growth and replication [A32026], and ultimately cell death. Mammalian cell demethylation is less sensitive to isavuconazole inhibition [FDA Label].%0A%0AMechanism of resistance and reduced susceptibility to isavuconazole arises from mutations in the fungal cyp51A and cyp51B genes coding for the target protein lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase [L1482].

Metformin decreases blood glucose levels by decreasing hepatic glucose production (gluconeogenesis), decreasing the intestinal absorption of glucose, and increasing insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization [FDA label]. It is well established that metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity, and it has since been generally postulated that its potent antidiabetic effects occur through this mechanism [A36534, A36557].   The above processes lead to a decrease in blood glucose, managing type II diabetes and exerting positive effects on glycemic control.%0A%0AAfter ingestion, the organic cation transporter-1 (OCT1) is responsible for the uptake of metformin into hepatocytes (liver cells). As this drug is positively charged, it accumulates in cells and in the mitochondria because of the membrane potentials across the plasma membrane as well as the mitochondrial inner membrane. Metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I, preventing the production of mitochondrial ATP leading to increased cytoplasmic ADP:ATP and AMP:ATP ratios [A36534]. These changes activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an enzyme that plays an important role in the regulation of glucose metabolism [A176348]. Aside from this mechanism, AMPK can be activated by a lysosomal mechanism involving other activators.  Following this process, increases in AMP:ATP ratio also inhibit _fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase_ enzyme, resulting in the inhibition of gluconeogenesis, while also inhibiting _adenylate cyclase_ and decreasing the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) [A36534], a derivative of ATP used for cell signaling [A176351]. Activated AMPK phosphorylates two isoforms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme, thereby inhibiting fat synthesis and leading to fat oxidation, reducing hepatic lipid stores and increasing liver sensitivity to insulin [A36534].  %0A%0AIn the intestines, metformin increases anaerobic glucose metabolism in enterocytes (intestinal cells), leading to reduced net glucose uptake and increased delivery of lactate to the liver. Recent studies have also implicated the gut as a primary site of action of metformin and suggest that the liver may not be as important for metformin action in patients with type 2 diabetes. Some of the ways metformin may play a role on the intestines is by promoting the metabolism of glucose by increasing glucagon-like peptide I (GLP-1) as well as increasing gut utilization of glucose  [A36534]. %0A%0AIn addition to the above pathway, the mechanism of action of metformin may be explained by other ways, and its exact mechanism of action has been under extensive study in recent years [A36535, A36554, A36555, A36557].",ACACB|PRKAB1|INS,insulin sensitizer

It is suggested that MTIC then alkylates DNA at the N7 position of guanine, O3 position of adenosine, and O6 position of guanosine, with the most common site being the N7 position. This methylation of guanine residues lead to single and double-strand DNA breaks and subsequent apoptotic cell death. It is suggested that the N7-methylguanine plays a critical role in the antitumor activity of the drug, as there is a correlation between the sensitivity of tumor cell lines to temozolomide and the activity of O6-alkylguanine alkyltransferase, which is the DNA repair protein that specifically removes alkyl groups at the O6 position of guanine. Cells lines that have lower levels of AGT are more sensitive to the cytotoxicity of temozolomide. It is also suggested that cytotoxic mechanism of temozolomide is related to the failure of the DNA MMR system to find a complementary base for methylated guanine. The DNA MMR system is involved in the formation of a number of proteins that remove methylated guanine. Evidence shows that when this repair process is targeted to the DNA strand opposite the O6-methylguanine, its inability to find the correct target leads to long-lived nicks in the DNA.

It binds to melatonin receptor type 1A, which then acts on adenylate cylcase and the inhibition of a cAMP signal transduction pathway. Melatonin not only inhibits adenylate cyclase, but it also activates phosphilpase C. This potentiates the release of arachidonate. By binding to melatonin receptors 1 and 2, the downstream signallling cascades have various effects in the body. The melatonin receptors are G protein-coupled receptors and are expressed in various tissues of the body. There are two subtypes of the receptor in humans, melatonin receptor 1 (MT1) and melatonin receptor 2 (MT2). Melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists, on market or in clinical trials, all bind to and activate both receptor types.The binding of the agonists to the receptors has been investigated for over two decades or since 1986. It is somewhat known, but still not fully understood. When melatonin receptor agonists bind to and activate their receptors it causes numerous physiological processes.%0AMT1 receptors are expressed in many regions of the central nervous system (CNS): suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SNC), hippocampus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, central dopaminergic pathways, ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens. MT1 is also expressed in the retina, ovary, testis, mammary gland, coronary circulation and aorta, gallbladder, liver, kidney, skin and the immune system. MT2 receptors are expressed mainly in the CNS, also in the lung, cardiac, coronary and aortic tissue, myometrium and granulosa cells, immune cells, duodenum and adipocytes.%0AThe binding of melatonin to melatonin receptors activates a few signaling pathways. MT1 receptor activation inhibits the adenylyl cyclase and its inhibition causes a rippling effect of non activation; starting with decreasing formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and then progressing to less protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which in turn hinders the phosphorilation of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB binding protein) into P-CREB. MT1 receptors also activate phospholipase C (PLC), affect ion channels and regulate ion flux inside the cell. The binding of melatonin to MT2 receptors inhibits adenylyl cyclase which decreases the formation of cAMP.[4] As well it hinders guanylyl cyclase and therefore the forming of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Binding to MT2 receptors probably affects PLC which increases protein kinase C (PKC) activity.

This steroid compound is also believed to exhibit activity as a barbiturate-like, positive allosteric modulator of both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(a) receptors [FDA Label][F4063, F4072]. In doing so, brexanolone can enhance the activity of GABA at such receptors by having GABA(a) receptor calcium channels open more often and for longer periods of time. Furthermore, it is believed that brexanolone elicits such action on GABA(a) receptors at a binding site that is distinct from those associated with benzodiazepines [F4072].%0A%0AConcurrently, GABA is considered the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human body [A175423, A175438, A175441]. When GABA binds to GABA(a) receptors found in neuron synapses, chloride ions are conducted across neuron cell membranes via an ion channel in the receptors [A175423, A175438, A175441, F3787]. With enough chloride ions conducted, the local, associated neuron membrane potentials are hyperpolarized - making it more difficult or less likely for action potentials to fire, ultimately resulting in less excitation of the neurons, like those involved in neuronal pathways that may be in part responsible for eliciting certain traits of PPD like stress, anxiety, etc [A175423, A175438, A175441, F3787]. %0A%0APostpartum depression (PPD) is a mood disorder that can affect women after childbirth [FDA Label][A176080, A176083, F4063, F4066, F4072]. Women with PPD experience feelings of extreme sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion that can make it difficult or even dangerous for them to perform various daily activities or care for themselves or for others, including newborn [FDA Label][A176080, A176083, F4063, F4066, F4072]. Although the exact pathophysiology of PPD remains unknown, it is believed that altered profiles and rapid, unpredictable fluctuations in the blood concentrations of neuroactive steroids like endogenous brexanolone (among others), GABA, and GABA receptors occur in women who are at risk of PPD after childbirth [FDA Label][A176080, A176083, F4063, F4072].%0A%0AIn particular, within the context of PPD, it is proposed that endogenous brexanolone levels can quickly drop or fluctuate variedly after childbirth and that GABA(a) receptor levels and expression are decreased and down-regulated throughout pregnancy [F4063]. Such fluctuations and decreases may consequently leave women susceptible to the possibility of PPD. As a medication, synthetic brexanolone can subsequently facilitate a return of positive allosteric modulator GABA(a) modulation while GABA(a) receptor levels and expression gradually return to normal in the time following postpartum [F4063]. As such, studies suggest the potential for the development of brexanolone as a new mechanism for treatment of PPD that is directly related to the underlying pathophysiology as opposed to many other antidepressant medications whose pharmacological actions are usually entirely unrelated.

It binds to melatonin receptor type 1A, which then acts on adenylate cylcase and the inhibition of a cAMP signal transduction pathway. Melatonin not only inhibits adenylate cyclase, but it also activates phosphilpase C. This potentiates the release of arachidonate. By binding to melatonin receptors 1 and 2, the downstream signallling cascades have various effects in the body. The melatonin receptors are G protein-coupled receptors and are expressed in various tissues of the body. There are two subtypes of the receptor in humans, melatonin receptor 1 (MT1) and melatonin receptor 2 (MT2). Melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists, on market or in clinical trials, all bind to and activate both receptor types.The binding of the agonists to the receptors has been investigated for over two decades or since 1986. It is somewhat known, but still not fully understood. When melatonin receptor agonists bind to and activate their receptors it causes numerous physiological processes.%0AMT1 receptors are expressed in many regions of the central nervous system (CNS): suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SNC), hippocampus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, central dopaminergic pathways, ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens. MT1 is also expressed in the retina, ovary, testis, mammary gland, coronary circulation and aorta, gallbladder, liver, kidney, skin and the immune system. MT2 receptors are expressed mainly in the CNS, also in the lung, cardiac, coronary and aortic tissue, myometrium and granulosa cells, immune cells, duodenum and adipocytes.%0AThe binding of melatonin to melatonin receptors activates a few signaling pathways. MT1 receptor activation inhibits the adenylyl cyclase and its inhibition causes a rippling effect of non activation; starting with decreasing formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and then progressing to less protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which in turn hinders the phosphorilation of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB binding protein) into P-CREB. MT1 receptors also activate phospholipase C (PLC), affect ion channels and regulate ion flux inside the cell. The binding of melatonin to MT2 receptors inhibits adenylyl cyclase which decreases the formation of cAMP.[4] As well it hinders guanylyl cyclase and therefore the forming of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Binding to MT2 receptors probably affects PLC which increases protein kinase C (PKC) activity.

It reduces toxicity and cell-death associated with two cytotoxic intermediates: 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP).  By pre-administering with uridine (as the prodrug uridine triacetate), higher doses of 5-FU can be given allowing for improved efficacy and a reduction in toxic side effects [A18578] such as neutropenia, mucositis, diarrhea, and hand–foot syndrome. %0A%0AUridine triacetate is also used for replacement therapy in the treatment of hereditary orotic aciduria, also known as uridine monophosphate synthase (UMPS) deficiency.

Intensive research in animal models of human cancer has demonstrated that Bardoxolone is a potent anticancer agent with a well-characterized ability to inhibit growth and cause regression of tumors as a single agent and in combination with radiation and chemotherapy. Bardoxolone also suppresses radiation- and chemotherapy-induced damage (e.g., oral mucositis) in normal tissues at dose levels that also produce an anti-cancer effect. Bardoxolone induces apoptosis through both caspase-independent and -dependent mechanisms, the latter involving caspase-8 activation, Bid cleavage, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activation.

DNA alkylating agents cause cell death through excessive DNA damage by adduct formation. The human mechanism for DNA repair is very efficient and cancer therapeutics which use this mechanism are often ineffective due to resistance by efficient repair mechanisms such as base excision repair (BER). Alkylating agents such as tezmozolomide form methylated DNA adducts such as O6-methylguanine (O6mG), 7-methylguanine (N7mG) and 3-methyladenine (N3mA). O6mG is a cytotoxic and genotoxic adduct which is repaired by O6-methylguanine DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT). O6mG’s cytotoxicity is due to the mismatch repair mechanism (MMR), but cell induced defects in this repair pathway can lead to drug resistance. The N7mG (dominant lesions caused by methylating agents) and N3mA adducts are both repaired by the BER mechanism. Methoxyamine disrupts the BER pathway, increasing the amount of cytotoxic adducts, which results in cell death. Methoxyamine inhibits BER by stabilizing the AP sites created by cleavage of BER glysosylates, forming MX-AP lesions. %0A%0AMethoxyamine may be an effective adjunct to iododeoxyuridine(IUdR) induced radiosensitization and radiation treatment. IUdR is a halogenated pyrimidine which is incorporated into cellular DNA instead of thymidine, which enhances radiotumor sensitivity. Methoxyamine is proposed to have a dual action in this treatment as it alters cell cycle kinetics as well as prevents repair of DNA by BER, allowing increased sensitivity of tumor cells to DNA damage by radiation therapy. The efficiency of cell cycle repair has been shown to be cell cycle dependent, with the G1 phase being second most sensitive to ionizing radiation (the mitotic, M, phase is the most sensitive). Methoxyamine increases the amount of protein 53 (P53) and protein Rb (pRB), senescence factors which cause the cell to remain in the G1 phase. Methoxyamine also creates a stringent checkpoint at the G1/S boundary as well as an insufficient checkpoint at the G2 stage, preventing cells from going into the S phase. The increased number of G1 cells makes methoxyamine treated tumors more susceptible to ionizing radiation. %0A%0AThe temozolomide and methoxyamine created lesion MX-AP not only disrupts the BER pathway but inhibits topoisomerase II alpha (topo II), an enzyme necessary for DNA replication, recombination and chromosome segregation. MX-AP sites block DNA replication and interfere with choromosome splitting. It is currently uncertain how what the interaction between topoisomerase II and methoxyamine causes cytotoxicity, but several mechanisms have been proposed, such as MX-AP sites binding to topo II, thus reducing their functionality by forming a toxic complex.%0A",APEX1,DNA repair enzyme inhibitor

Biochemically, glucosamine is involved in glycoprotein metabolism. Glycoproteins, known as proteoglycans, form the ground substance in the extra-cellular matrix of connective tissue. Proteoglycans are polyanionic substances of high-molecular weight and contain many different types of heteropolysaccharide side-chains covalently linked to a polypeptide-chain backbone. These polysaccharides make up to 95% of the proteoglycan structure. In fact, chemically, proteoglycans resemble polysaccharides more than they do proteins. The polysaccharide groups in proteoglycans are called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs include hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate, heparin and heparan sulfate. All of the GAGs contain derivatives of glucosamine or galactosamine. Glucosamine derivatives are found in hyaluronic acid, keratan sulfate and heparan sulfate. Chondroitin sulfate contains derivatives of galactosamine. The glucosamine-containing glycosaminoglycan hyaluronic acid is vital for the function of articular cartilage. GAG chains are fundamental components of aggrecan found in articular cartilage. Aggrecan confers upon articular cartilage shock-absorbing properties. It does this by providing cartilage with a swelling pressure that is restrained by the tensile forces of collagen fibers. This balance confers upon articular cartilage the deformable resilience vital to its function. In the early stages of degenerative joint disease, aggrecan biosynthesis is increased. However, in later stages, aggrecan synthesis is decreased, leading eventually to the loss of cartilage resiliency and to most of the symptoms that accompany osteoarthritis. During the progression of osteoarthritis, exogenous glucosamine may have a beneficial role. It is known that, in vitro, chondrocytes do synthesize more aggregan when the culture medium is supplemented with glucosamine. N-acetylglucosamine is found to be less effective in these in vitro studies. Glucosamine has also been found to have antioxidant activity and to be beneficial in animal models of experimental arthritis. The counter anion of the glucosamine salt (i.e. chloride or sulfate) is unlikely to play any role in the action or pharmacokinetics of glucosamine. Further, the sulfate in glucosamine sulfate supplements should not be confused with the glucosamine sulfate found in such GAGs as keratan sulfate and heparan sulfate. In the case of the supplement, sulfate is the anion of the salt. In the case of the above GAGs, sulfate is present as an ester. Also, there is no glucosamine sulfate in chondroitin sulfate (source: PDRhealth).",RENBP|B4GALT2|B4GALT1|B4GALT4|B4GALT3|NAGK|NAGLU|NAGPA,

There are several proposed mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory action of corticosteroids. Corticosteroids may work by increasing the transcription of genes coding for anti-inflammatory proteins, including lipocortin-1 and interleukin-10.[A179875] Corticosteroids were also shown to inhibit the expression of multiple genes that encode pro-inflammatory factors, such as cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules, that are activated during the chronic inflammatory process.[A31449] This is thought to be due to the direct inhibitory interaction between activated glucocorticoid receptors and activated pro-inflammatory transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-kappa B and activator protein-1.[A179875] Chronic inflammation is often characterized by enhanced expression of these transcription factors that bind to and activate coactivator molecules, which then acetylate core histones to switch on gene transcription to further amplify the inflammatory process.[A31449] Corticosteroids suppress the multiple inflammatory gene expression by promoting histone deacetylation, resulting in tighter coiling of DNA and reduced access of transcription factors to their binding sites.[A179875] ",SERPINA6|NR3C1|GPR97|CYP3A5,glucocorticoid receptor agonist

L-glutamine appears to play a major role in protecting the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract and, in particular, the large intestine. During catabolic states, the integrity of the intestinal mucosa may be compromised with consequent increased intestinal permeability and translocation of Gram-negative bacteria from the large intestine into the body. The demand for L-glutamine by the intestine, as well as by cells such as lymphocytes, appears to be much greater than that supplied by skeletal muscle, the major storage tissue for L-glutamine. L-glutamine is the preferred respiratory fuel for enterocytes, colonocytes and lymphocytes. Therefore, supplying supplemental L-glutamine under these conditions may do a number of things. For one, it may reverse the catabolic state by sparing skeletal muscle L-glutamine. It also may inhibit translocation of Gram-negative bacteria from the large intestine. L-glutamine helps maintain secretory IgA, which functions primarily by preventing the attachment of bacteria to mucosal cells. L-glutamine appears to be required to support the proliferation of mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes, as well as the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). It is also required for the maintenance of lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK). L-glutamine can enhance phagocytosis by neutrophils and monocytes. It can lead to an increased synthesis of glutathione in the intestine, which may also play a role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosa by ameliorating oxidative stress. The exact mechanism of the possible immunomodulatory action of supplemental L-glutamine, however, remains unclear. It is conceivable that the major effect of L-glutamine occurs at the level of the intestine. Perhaps enteral L-glutamine acts directly on intestine-associated lymphoid tissue and stimulates overall immune function by that mechanism, without passing beyond the splanchnic bed.%0A%0AThe exact mechanism of L-glutamine's effect on NAD redox potential is unknown but is thought to involve increased amounts of reduced glutathione made available by glutamine supplementation [FDA Label].

It is non-selective for COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Inhibition of COX-1 results in the inhibition of platelet aggregation for about 7-10 days (average platelet lifespan). The acetyl group of acetylsalicylic acid binds with a serine residue of the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme, leading to irreversible inhibition. This prevents the production of pain-causing prostaglandins. This process also stops the conversion of arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which is a potent inducer of platelet aggregation [FDA label].  Platelet aggregation can result in clots and harmful venous and arterial thromboembolism, leading to conditions such as pulmonary embolism and stroke. %0A%0AIt is important to note that there is 60% homology between the protein structures of COX-1 and COX-2.

Amrubicin is found to form complexes with DNA via intercalation between base pairs, and it inhibits topoisomerase II enzyme activity by stabilizing the DNA-topoisomerase II complex, which prevents the re-ligation portion of the ligation-religation reaction that topoisomerase II normally catalyzes [L1710].%0A%0ATopoisomerase II is an enzyme located in the nucleus that regulates DNA structure through double-strand breakage and re-ligation, therefore modulating DNA replication and transcription. Inhibition of the enzyme leads to inhibition of DNA replication and halt cell growth with an arrest of the cell cycle occurring at the G2/M phase. The mechanism by which amrubicin inhibits DNA topoisomerase II is believed to be through stabilization of the cleavable DNA–topo II complex, ending in re-ligation failure and DNA strand breakage [L1710, A4138]. %0A%0ADNA damage triggers activation of caspase-3 and -7 and cleavage of the enzyme PARP (Poly ADP ribose polymerase), leading to apoptosis and a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential.

Tubulin is the ""building block"" of microtubules, and the binding of docetaxel locks these building blocks in place. The resulting microtubule/docetaxel complex does not have the ability to disassemble. This adversely affects cell function because the shortening and lengthening of microtubules (termed dynamic instability) is necessary for their function as a transportation highway for the cell. Chromosomes, for example, rely upon this property of microtubules during mitosis.

It binds to melatonin receptor type 1A, which then acts on adenylate cylcase and the inhibition of a cAMP signal transduction pathway. Melatonin not only inhibits adenylate cyclase, but it also activates phosphilpase C. This potentiates the release of arachidonate. By binding to melatonin receptors 1 and 2, the downstream signallling cascades have various effects in the body. The melatonin receptors are G protein-coupled receptors and are expressed in various tissues of the body. There are two subtypes of the receptor in humans, melatonin receptor 1 (MT1) and melatonin receptor 2 (MT2). Melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists, on market or in clinical trials, all bind to and activate both receptor types.The binding of the agonists to the receptors has been investigated for over two decades or since 1986. It is somewhat known, but still not fully understood. When melatonin receptor agonists bind to and activate their receptors it causes numerous physiological processes.%0AMT1 receptors are expressed in many regions of the central nervous system (CNS): suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SNC), hippocampus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, central dopaminergic pathways, ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens. MT1 is also expressed in the retina, ovary, testis, mammary gland, coronary circulation and aorta, gallbladder, liver, kidney, skin and the immune system. MT2 receptors are expressed mainly in the CNS, also in the lung, cardiac, coronary and aortic tissue, myometrium and granulosa cells, immune cells, duodenum and adipocytes.%0AThe binding of melatonin to melatonin receptors activates a few signaling pathways. MT1 receptor activation inhibits the adenylyl cyclase and its inhibition causes a rippling effect of non activation; starting with decreasing formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and then progressing to less protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which in turn hinders the phosphorilation of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB binding protein) into P-CREB. MT1 receptors also activate phospholipase C (PLC), affect ion channels and regulate ion flux inside the cell. The binding of melatonin to MT2 receptors inhibits adenylyl cyclase which decreases the formation of cAMP.[4] As well it hinders guanylyl cyclase and therefore the forming of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Binding to MT2 receptors probably affects PLC which increases protein kinase C (PKC) activity.

When complexed with these proteins and Ran, activated through guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding, the XPO1-protein-Ran-GTP complex is able to exit the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Once outside, GTP is hydrolyzed and the complex dissociates.[A180262] The inhibition of this process in cancer cells allows the targets of XPO1, many of which are tumor suppressors, to collect in the nucleus and result in increased transcription of tumor suppressor genes. Tumor suppressor proteins known to be affected by XPO1 inhibition include p53, p73, adenomatous polyposis coli, retinoblastoma, forkhead box protein O, breast cancer 1, nucleophosmin, and merlin. Regulators of cell cycle progression are also affected, namely p21, p27, galectin-3, and Tob.

This steroid compound is also believed to exhibit activity as a barbiturate-like, positive allosteric modulator of both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(a) receptors [FDA Label][F4063, F4072]. In doing so, brexanolone can enhance the activity of GABA at such receptors by having GABA(a) receptor calcium channels open more often and for longer periods of time. Furthermore, it is believed that brexanolone elicits such action on GABA(a) receptors at a binding site that is distinct from those associated with benzodiazepines [F4072].%0A%0AConcurrently, GABA is considered the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human body [A175423, A175438, A175441]. When GABA binds to GABA(a) receptors found in neuron synapses, chloride ions are conducted across neuron cell membranes via an ion channel in the receptors [A175423, A175438, A175441, F3787]. With enough chloride ions conducted, the local, associated neuron membrane potentials are hyperpolarized - making it more difficult or less likely for action potentials to fire, ultimately resulting in less excitation of the neurons, like those involved in neuronal pathways that may be in part responsible for eliciting certain traits of PPD like stress, anxiety, etc [A175423, A175438, A175441, F3787]. %0A%0APostpartum depression (PPD) is a mood disorder that can affect women after childbirth [FDA Label][A176080, A176083, F4063, F4066, F4072]. Women with PPD experience feelings of extreme sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion that can make it difficult or even dangerous for them to perform various daily activities or care for themselves or for others, including newborn [FDA Label][A176080, A176083, F4063, F4066, F4072]. Although the exact pathophysiology of PPD remains unknown, it is believed that altered profiles and rapid, unpredictable fluctuations in the blood concentrations of neuroactive steroids like endogenous brexanolone (among others), GABA, and GABA receptors occur in women who are at risk of PPD after childbirth [FDA Label][A176080, A176083, F4063, F4072].%0A%0AIn particular, within the context of PPD, it is proposed that endogenous brexanolone levels can quickly drop or fluctuate variedly after childbirth and that GABA(a) receptor levels and expression are decreased and down-regulated throughout pregnancy [F4063]. Such fluctuations and decreases may consequently leave women susceptible to the possibility of PPD. As a medication, synthetic brexanolone can subsequently facilitate a return of positive allosteric modulator GABA(a) modulation while GABA(a) receptor levels and expression gradually return to normal in the time following postpartum [F4063]. As such, studies suggest the potential for the development of brexanolone as a new mechanism for treatment of PPD that is directly related to the underlying pathophysiology as opposed to many other antidepressant medications whose pharmacological actions are usually entirely unrelated.

This inhibition results in a halt in production of ergosterol, a molecule typically found in the membranes of fungi such as Aspergillus, Candida, and Mucorales that plays a role in regulation of membrane integrity, fluidity and permeability. The inhibition of Erg11p also causes the buildup of ergosterol precursors, which are toxic and cause cell death. |Isavuconazole displays fungicidal actions by disrupting the biosynthesis of ergosterol, which is a key component of fungal cell membrane. It inhibits cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase that mediates the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. The side arm of of the active isavuconazole molecule allows for greater affinity for the binding pocket in the fungal CYP51 protein by orienting the triazole ring of the molecule to engage with the heme moiety at the bottom of the binding pocket [A32026, A32029]. This explains the wide antifungal spectrum of isavuconazole and possible cross-resistance to other triazoles [A32026, A32029]. As a result of lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase inhibition, toxic methylated sterol precursors such as 14-α-methylated lanosterol, 4,14-dimethylzymosterol, and 24-methylenedihydrolanosterol alter the function of fungal membrane and accumulate within the fungal cytoplasm [A32029].

Mammalian cell demethylation is less sensitive to isavuconazole inhibition [FDA Label].%0A%0AMechanism of resistance and reduced susceptibility to isavuconazole arises from mutations in the fungal cyp51A and cyp51B genes coding for the target protein lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase [L1482].

It does this by producing the glutathione precursor L-cysteine. Glutathione is required to inactivate an intermediate metabolite (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine or NAPQI) of acetaminophen that is thought to be hepatotoxic. In acetaminophen overdose cases, excessive quantities of this metabolite are formed because the primary metabolic (glucuronide and sulfate conjugation) pathways become saturated. Acetylcysteine may act by reducing the metabolite to the parent compound and/or by providing sulfhydryl for conjugation of the metabolite. Experimental evidence also suggests that a sulfhydryl-containing compound such as acetylcysteine may also directly inactivate the metabolite. The mechanisms of action for acetylcysteine’s well-known mucolytic effects are different.  In particular, when inhaled, acetylcysteine (and its metabolic byproduct cysteine) exerts its mucolytic action through its free sulfhydryl group, which reduces the disulfide bonds in the mucus matrix and lowers mucus viscosity. This action increases with increasing pH and is most significant at pH 7 to 9. The mucolytic action of acetylcysteine is not affected by the presence of DNA. Acetylcysteine is also an antioxidant and reduces oxidative stress. Acetylcysteine serves as a prodrug to L-cysteine which is a precursor to the biologic antioxidant, glutathione and hence administration of acetylcysteine replenishes glutathione stores. L-cysteine also serves as a precursor to cystine which in turn serves as a substrate for the cystine-glutamate antiporter on astrocytes hence increasing glutamate release into the extracellular space. This glutamate in turn acts on mGluR2/3 receptors, and at higher doses of acetylcysteine, mGluR5. Glutathione also modulates the NMDA receptor by acting at the redox site. These effects on glutamate and NMDA signaling appear to explain some of the positive neuropsychotropic effects associated with NAC.  Acetylcysteine also possesses some anti-inflammatory effects possibly via inhibiting NF-κB through redox activation of the nuclear factor kappa kinases thereby modulating cytokine synthesis.",GRIN1|GRIN3A|GRIN2D|GRIN2B|GRIN2A|RELA|IKBKB|SLC7A11|ACY1|GSS|CHUK,mucolytic agent

Based on the findings of competitive binding assays, raloxifene displays binding affinity that is similar to that of [estradiol][A721], the predominant circulating estrogen.[A178861] Estrogens play variable roles at different tissues in females, including the bone, breasts, uterus and liver, by binding to the steroid nuclear hormone receptors, Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERα) or Estrogen Receptor beta (ERβ).[A178861] These receptors are normally bound to the Heat Shock Protein 90 (Hsp90) when unbound to the ligand. Ligand binding induces a conformational change in the receptor that promotes dissociation of the receptor from Hsp90, dimerization and translocation into the nucleus. This movement into the nucleus allows the receptor to bind to genomic locations based on sequence recognition of the DNA binding domain, also known as the Estrogen Response Elements (EREs).[A178861] %0A%0AIn bones, endogenous estrogens normally modulate multiple DNA response elements, including the gene-encoding transforming growth factor-β3 (TGF-β3), which is a cytokine embedded in the bone matrix.[T28] TGF-β3 plays an important role in bone remodelling[A178756] by working with other cytokines to induce production of osteoblasts, such as IL-6[A720], and attenuate the activity of osetoclasts. Estrogens typically maintain the bone integrity by inhibiting the cytokines that recruit osteoclasts and oppose the bone-resorbing, Ca2+-mobilizing action of parathyroid hormone. In contrast, estrogens promote osteoblast proliferation, augment the production of TGF-β3 and bone morphogenic proteins, and inhibit apoptosis.[T28] Mimicking the action of endogenous estrogen in bone tissues, raloxifene binds to the estrogen receptor to influence gene transcription through interactions with the estrogen response element (ERE) and a distinct DNA target, the raloxifene response element (RRE).[A722] It occupies the same ER ligand binding site as estrogen.[A724] Upon binding, raloxifene induces a conformational change of the receptor, allowing mediation of direct binding to transcriptional elements by accessory proteins. Increased expression of bone matrix proteins, such as alkaline phosphatase, osteonectin, osteocalcin and collagen may be seen.[A722] The agonistic or antagonistic action of raloxifene depends on the extent of recruitment of coactivators and corepressors to estrogen receptor (ER) target gene promotors.[label] In breast tissues, raloxifene acts as an estrogen receptor antagonist to attenuate the estrogen-dependent proliferative effects of epithelial cell expansion. In addition to the antiproliferative effects, raloxifene prevents the production of cytokines and recruitment of macrophages and lymphocytes into tumor mass.[A178921]",ESR2|ESR1|ENG|ACVRL1,estrogen receptor antagonist%7Cselective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM)

These neurons project to aminergic neurons, such as histaminergic or noradrenergic neurons, that are responsible for the effects of orexin and control of wakefulness.[A32025] Histamine H3 receptors are presynaptic inhibitory autoreceptors [A183077] that are located in the cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and basal ganglia.[A39822] H3 receptors promote the re-uptake of histamine at synaptic terminals and attenuate further histamine release into the synapse.[A32025] By blocking H3 autoreceptors and increasing the levels of histamine transmitters at the synapse, pitolisant enhances the activity of histaminergic neurons and promotes wakefulness.[L1471] Inverse agonism of pitolisant at H3 receptors also leads to enhanced synthesis and release of endogenous histamine over the basal level.[A32025]%0A%0APitolisant acts as a high-affinity competitive antagonist (Ki 0.16 nM) and as an inverse agonist (EC50 1.5 nM) at the human H3 receptor [A32022] and mediates its pharmacological action at the presynaptic level.[A39822] It is thought to bind to the antagonist binding site of the H3 receptor, which is located within the transmembrane core just below the extracellular loops. Piperidines form a salt bridge with Glu206 in the membrane-spanning segment, and the hydroxyl of Tyr374 is H-bonded with the central oxygen of piperidine.[A32025] Pitolisant displays high selectivity for H3 receptors compared to other histamine receptor subtypes. Pitolisant also modulates acetylcholine, noradrenaline and dopamine release in the brain by increasing the levels of neurotransmitters but does not increase dopamine release in the stratal complex, including the nucleus accumbens.[L1471] At lower nanomolar concentrations, pitolisant acts as an inverse agonist at H3 receptors and enhances the release of endogenous histamine over the basal level.[A32025]",HRH3,histamine receptor antagonist

Aripiprazole functions as a partial agonist at the dopamine D2 and the serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, and as an antagonist at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor [FDA Label]. The desired outcome of antipsuchotic agents in schizophrenia is to inhibit dopaminergic transmission in the limbic system and enhance dopaminergic transmission in the prefrontal cortex. As a partial agonist at D2 receptors in the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway, aripiprazole acts as a functional antagonist in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway and reduces the extent of dopaminergic pathway activity. This results in reduced positive symptoms in schizophrenia and extrapyramidal motor side effects [A34403]. In contrast, aripiprazole is thought to act as a functional agonist in the mesocortical pathway, where reduced dopamine activity is seen in association with negative symptoms and cognitive impairment [A34403]. Antagonism at 5-HT2A receptors by aripiprazole alleviates the negative symptoms and cognitive impairment of schizophrenia [T28]. 5-HT2A receptors are Gi/Go-coupled that upon activation, produce neuronal inhibition via decreased neuronal excitability and decreased transmitter release at the nerve terminals. In the nigrostriatal pathway, 5-HT2A regulates the release of dopamine. Through antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors, aripiprazole disinhibits the release of dopamine in the striatum and enhance the levels of the transmitters at the nerve terminals [T28]. The combined effects of D2 and 5-HT2A antagonism are thought to counteract the increased dopamine function causing increased extrapyramidal side effects [T28]. Blocking 5-HT2A receptors may also lead to the modulation of glutamate release in the mesocortical circuit, which is a transmitter that plays a role in schizophrenia [A34403]. 5-HT1A receptors are autoreceptors that inhibit 5-HT release upon activation. Aripiprazole is a partial agonist at theses receptors and reduces 5-HT release; this results in potentiated dopamine release in the striatum and prefrontal cortex [T28]. It is reported that therapeutic doses of aripiprazole occupies up to 90% of brain D2 receptors in a dose-dependent manner [A4965]. %0A%0AApripiprazole targets different receptors that lead to drug-related adverse reactions; for example, the antagonist activity at the alpha-1 adrenergic receptors results in orthostatic hypotension [A34289]. Aripiprazole's antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug [A34289].",HTR3A|HTR1A|HTR1D|HTR1E|HTR1B|HTR2A|HTR2C|CHRM5|CHRM3|CHRM4|CHRM1|CHRM2|DRD5|DRD1|DRD2|DRD3|DRD4|HTR7|HTR6|HRH1|ADRA1B|ADRA1A|ADRA2C|ADRA2A|ADRA2B,serotonin receptor agonist%7Cserotonin receptor antagonist

Ribavirin triphosphate (RTP) is the predominant metabolite which directly inhibits viral mRNA polymerase by binding to the nucleotide binding site of the enzyme. This prevents the binding of the correct nucleotides, leading to a reduction in viral replication or to the production of defective virions [A19645]. RTP also demonstrates an inhibitory action on viral mRNA guanylyltransferase and mRNA 2′-O-methyltransferase of dengue virus. Inhibition of these enzymes disrupts the posttranslational capping of the 5′ end of viral mRNA through ribavirin being incorporated at the 5′ end in place of guanosine and preventing the cap methylation step. %0A%0AInhibition of host inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and subsequent depletion of GTP pool is proposed to be another mechanism of action of ribavirin. IMPDH catalyzes the rate-limiting step where inosine 5′-monophosphate is converted to xanthine monophosphate during guanosine monophosphate (GMP) synthesis. GMP is later converted to guanosine triphoshpate (GTP). Ribavirin monophosphate mimics inosine 5′-monophosphate and acts as a competitive inhibitor of IMPDH. Inhibited de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides and decreased intracellular GTP pools leads to a decline in viral protein synthesis and limit replication of viral genomes [A19645].%0A%0ARibavirin acts as a mutagen in the target virus to cause an 'error catastrophe' due to increased viral mutations. RTP pairs with cytidine triphosphate or uridine triphosphate with equal efficiency and to block HCV RNA elongation. It causes premature termination of nascent HCV RNA and increases mutagenesis by producing defective virions [A19645].%0A%0ARibavirin also exerts an immunomodulatory action of the host to the virus by shifting a Th2 response in favor of a Th1 phenotype. Th2 response and production of type 2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 stimulates the humoral response which enhances immunity toward the virus [A19645]. Ribavirin enhanced induction of interferon-related genes, including the interferon-α receptor, and down-regulation of genes involved in interferon inhibition, apoptosis, and hepatic stellate cell activation in vitro [A19644].

Inhibition of these enzymes disrupts the posttranslational capping of the 5′ end of viral mRNA through ribavirin being incorporated at the 5′ end in place of guanosine and preventing the cap methylation step. %0A%0AInhibition of host inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and subsequent depletion of GTP pool is proposed to be another mechanism of action of ribavirin. IMPDH catalyzes the rate-limiting step where inosine 5′-monophosphate is converted to xanthine monophosphate during guanosine monophosphate (GMP) synthesis. GMP is later converted to guanosine triphoshpate (GTP). Ribavirin monophosphate mimics inosine 5′-monophosphate and acts as a competitive inhibitor of IMPDH. Inhibited de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides and decreased intracellular GTP pools leads to a decline in viral protein synthesis and limit replication of viral genomes [A19645].%0A%0ARibavirin acts as a mutagen in the target virus to cause an 'error catastrophe' due to increased viral mutations. RTP pairs with cytidine triphosphate or uridine triphosphate with equal efficiency and to block HCV RNA elongation. It causes premature termination of nascent HCV RNA and increases mutagenesis by producing defective virions [A19645].%0A%0ARibavirin also exerts an immunomodulatory action of the host to the virus by shifting a Th2 response in favor of a Th1 phenotype. Th2 response and production of type 2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 stimulates the humoral response which enhances immunity toward the virus [A19645]. Ribavirin enhanced induction of interferon-related genes, including the interferon-α receptor, and down-regulation of genes involved in interferon inhibition, apoptosis, and hepatic stellate cell activation in vitro [A19644].

The mechanism of action of naltrexone in alcoholism is not understood; however, involvement of the endogenous opioid system is suggested by preclinical data. Naltrexone is thought to act as a competitive antagonist at mc, κ, and δ receptors in the CNS, with the highest affintiy for the μ receptor. Naltrexone competitively binds to such receptors and may block the effects of endogenous opioids. This leads to the antagonization of most of the subjective and objective effects of opiates, including respiratory depression, miosis, euphoria, and drug craving.

Alternatively, when given as an injection the acetyl groups present in the diamorphine/diacetylmorphine compound confer the substance lipophilicity that facilitates diamorphine's rapid crossing of the blood-brain-barrier [L4996, L4999]. Once in the brain, diamorphine is metabolised via deacetylation to the active 6-MAM and morphine metabolites as well [L4996, L4999]. Despite diamorphine possessing little to no opioid agonist activity itself, its rapid transit across the blood-brain-barrier elicits a far faster onset of activity in comparison to the extensive first-pass metabolism of oral administration [L4996, L4999]. Regardless, the metabolism of diamorphine to morphine makes heroin a prodrug for the delivery of morphine [L4996, L4999].%0A%0AMorphine is subsequently a mu-opioid agonist. It acts on endogenous mu-opioid receptors that are spread in discrete packets throughout the brain, spinal cord and gut in almost all mammals [A2476]. Morphine, along with other opioids, are agonists to four endogenous neurotransmitters [A2476]. They are beta-endorphin, dynorphin, leu-enkephalin, and met-enkephalin [A2476]. The body responds to morphine in the brain by reducing (and sometimes stopping) production of the endogenous opioids when morphine is present [A2476]. Endorphins are regularly released in the brain and nerves, attenuating pain. Their other functions are still obscure, but are probably related to the effects produced by morphine besides analgesia (antitussin, anti-diarrheal) [A2476].%0A%0ANevertheless, morphine ultimately elicits the majority of its analgesic activity by binding to mu opioid receptors in both the central and peripheral nervous systems [L5005]. The overall effect of morphine is activation of descending inhibitory pathways of the central nervous system as well as inhibition of nociceptive afferent neurons of the peripheral nervous system, which results in an overall reduction of the nociceptive pain transmission [L5005]. |Morphine-6-glucuronide is responsible for approximately 85% of the response observed by morphine administration.[A176059] Morphine and its metabolites act as agonists of the mu and kappa opioid receptors.[A176035] The mu-opioid receptor is integral to morphine's effects on the ventral tegmental area of the brain. Morphine's activation of the reward pathway is mediated by agonism of the delta-opioid receptor in the nucleus accumbens,[A176050] while modification of the respiratory system and addiction disorder are mediated by agonism of the mu-opioid receptor.[A176056]",,

It is used to provide local anesthesia by nerve blockade at various sites in the body [F4349, L5930, L5948]. It does so by stabilizing the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action [F4349, L5930, L5948]. In particular, the lidocaine agent acts on sodium ion channels located on the internal surface of nerve cell membranes [F4349, L5930, L5948]. At these channels, neutral uncharged lidocaine molecules diffuse through neural sheaths into the axoplasm where they are subsequently ionized by joining with hydrogen ions [F4349, L5930, L5948]. The resultant lidocaine cations are then capable of reversibly binding the sodium channels from the inside, keeping them locked in an open state that prevents nerve depolarization [F4349, L5930, L5948]. As a result, with sufficient blockage, the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will ultimately not depolarize and will thus fail to transmit an action potential [F4349, L5930, L5948]. This facilitates an anesthetic effect by not merely preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain but by aborting their generation in the first place [F4349, L5930, L5948].%0A%0AIn addition to blocking conduction in nerve axons in the peripheral nervous system, lidocaine has important effects on the central nervous system and cardiovascular system [F4349, L5930, L5948]. After absorption, lidocaine may cause stimulation of the CNS followed by depression and in the cardiovascular system, it acts primarily on the myocardium where it may produce decreases in electrical excitability, conduction rate, and force of contraction [F4349, L5930, L5948].",SCN10A|SCN11A|SCN9A|SCN8A|SCN7A|SCN5A|SCN4A|SCN3A|SCN2A|SCN1A|EGFR,histamine receptor agonist

L-arginine is in turn responsible for citrulline's therapeutic affects. Many of L-arginine's activities, including its possible anti-atherogenic actions, may be accounted for by its role as the precursor to nitric oxide or NO. NO is produced by all tissues of the body and plays very important roles in the cardiovascular system, immune system and nervous system. NO is formed from L-arginine via the enzyme nitric oxide synthase or synthetase (NOS), and the effects of NO are mainly mediated by 3',5' -cyclic guanylate or cyclic GMP. NO activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic GMP from guanosine triphosphate or GTP. Cyclic GMP is converted to guanylic acid via the enzyme cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. <br/><br/>NOS is a heme-containing enzyme with some sequences similar to cytochrome P-450 reductase. Several isoforms of NOS exist, two of which are constitutive and one of which is inducible by immunological stimuli. The constitutive NOS found in the vascular endothelium is designated eNOS and that present in the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system is designated nNOS. The form of NOS induced by immunological or inflammatory stimuli is known as iNOS. iNOS may be expressed constitutively in select tissues such as lung epithelium. <br/><br/>All the nitric oxide synthases use NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) as cosubstrates, as well as the cofactors FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide), FMN (flavin mononucleotide), tetrahydrobiopterin and heme. Interestingly, ascorbic acid appears to enhance NOS activity by increasing intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin. eNOS and nNOS synthesize NO in response to an increased concentration of calcium ions or in some cases in response to calcium-independent stimuli, such as shear stress. <i>In vitro</i> studies of NOS indicate that the Km of the enzyme for L-arginine is in the micromolar range. The concentration of L-arginine in endothelial cells, as well as in other cells, and in plasma is in the millimolar range. What this means is that, under physiological conditions, NOS is saturated with its L-arginine substrate. In other words, L-arginine would not be expected to be rate-limiting for the enzyme, and it would not appear that supraphysiological levels of L-arginine which could occur with oral supplementation of the amino acid would make any difference with regard to NO production. The reaction would appear to have reached its maximum level. However, <i>in vivo</i> studies have demonstrated that, under certain conditions, e.g. hypercholesterolemia, L-arginine could enhance endothelial-dependent vasodilation and NO production.",,

Cysteine is typically synthesized in the human body when there is sufficient methionine available. Cysteine exhibits antioxidant properties and participates in redox reactions. Cysteine's antioxidant properties are typically expressed in the tripeptide glutathione, which occurs in humans as well as other organisms. Glutathione (GSH) typically requires biosynthesis from its constituent amino acids, cysteine, glycine, and glutamic acid, due to its limited systemic availability. Glutamic acid and glycine are readily available in the diets of most industrialized countries, but the availability of cysteine can be the limiting substrate. In human metabolism, cysteine is also involved in the generation of sulfide present in iron-sulfur clusters and nitrogenase by acting as a precursor. In a 1994 report released by five top cigarette companies, cysteine is one of the 599 additives to cigarettes. Its use or purpose, however, is unknown, like most cigarette additives. Its inclusion in cigarettes could offer two benefits: Acting as an expectorant, since smoking increases mucus production in the lungs; and increasing the beneficial antioxidant glutathione (which is diminished in smokers).",,

Iodine is considered as the active moiety that mediates microbicidal actions. When released from the complex, free iodine (I2) penetrates the cell wall of microorganisms quickly, and the lethal effects are believed to result from disruption of protein and nucleic acid structure and synthesis. While the full mechanism of action is not fully elucidated, iodine is thought to inhibit vital bacterial cellular mechanisms and structures, and oxidizes nucleotides fatty or amino acids in bacterial cell membranes [A32992]. Additionally, free iodine disrupts the function of the cytosolic enzymes involved in the respiratory chain, causing them to become denatured and deactivated [A32992]. _In vitro_ evidence suggests that iodine also counteracts inflammation elicited by both pathogens and the host response via multifactorial effects.

NO is produced by all tissues of the body and plays very important roles in the cardiovascular system, immune system and nervous system. NO is formed from L-arginine via the enzyme nitric oxide synthase or synthetase (NOS), and the effects of NO are mainly mediated by 3,'5' -cyclic guanylate or cyclic GMP. NO activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic GMP from guanosine triphosphate or GTP. Cyclic GMP is converted to guanylic acid via the enzyme cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. NOS is a heme-containing enzyme with some sequences similar to cytochrome P-450 reductase. Several isoforms of NOS exist, two of which are constitutive and one of which is inducible by immunological stimuli. The constitutive NOS found in the vascular endothelium is designated eNOS and that present in the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system is designated nNOS. The form of NOS induced by immunological or inflammatory stimuli is known as iNOS. iNOS may be expressed constitutively in select tissues such as lung epithelium. All the nitric oxide synthases use NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and oxygen (O2) as cosubstrates, as well as the cofactors FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide), FMN (flavin mononucleotide), tetrahydrobiopterin and heme. Interestingly, ascorbic acid appears to enhance NOS activity by increasing intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin. eNOS and nNOS synthesize NO in response to an increased concentration of calcium ions or in some cases in response to calcium-independent stimuli, such as shear stress. In vitro studies of NOS indicate that the Km of the enzyme for L-arginine is in the micromolar range. The concentration of L-arginine in endothelial cells, as well as in other cells, and in plasma is in the millimolar range. What this means is that, under physiological conditions, NOS is saturated with its L-arginine substrate. In other words, L-arginine would not be expected to be rate-limiting for the enzyme, and it would not appear that supraphysiological levels of L-arginine which could occur with oral supplementation of the amino acid^would make any difference with regard to NO production. The reaction would appear to have reached its maximum level. However, in vivo studies have demonstrated that, under certain conditions, e.g. hypercholesterolemia, supplemental L-arginine could enhance endothelial-dependent vasodilation and NO production.",,

An astrignent is a chemical that tends to shrink or constrict body tissues, usually locally after topical medicinal application.  The shrinkage or constriction is through osmotic flow of water (or other fluids) away from the area where the astringent was applied.  Astringent medicines cause shrinkage of mucous membranes or exposed tissues and are often used internally to check discharge of blood serum or mucous secretions. This can happen with a sore throat, hemorrhages, diarrhea, or with peptic ulcers. Externally applied astringents, which cause mild coagulation of skin proteins, dry, harden, and protect the skin. Acne sufferers are often advised to use astringents if they have oily skin. Astringents also help heal stretch marks and other scars. Mild astringent solutions are used in the relief of such minor skin irritations as those resulting from superficial cuts, allergies, insect bites, or fungal infections such as athlete's foot. |Aluminum hydroxide is a basic inorganic salt that acts by neutralizing hydrochloric acid in gastric secretions. Aluminum hydroxide is slowly solubilized in the stomach and reacts with hydrochloric acid to form aluminum chloride and water. It also inhibits the action of pepsin by increasing the pH and via adsorption. Cytoprotective effects may occur through increases in bicarbonate ion (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and prostaglandins.|The main functions of potassium alum in drugs are as an astringent, antiseptic or adjuvant agent. The astringent action is performed by the induction of coagulation in the superficial tissue layers until the formation of a crust. The formation of alum ions neutralize the charges on plasma proteins, causing the blood to coagulate. Similar effect is observed in disinfectants where these ions react with the free organic acid and thiol groups of proteins on microbes and free proteins, resulting in protein precipitation. This action will generate the contraction of the tissue and dry up secretions. Its adjuvant properties are mainly used in the production of vaccines where the presence of this chemical enhances the immune response.[L1076]|Aluminum chloride is commonly used topical antiperspirant. It is proposed that aluminum chloride works by causing an obstruction of the distal sweat gland ducts, where the metal ions precipitate with mucopolysaccharides, damaging epithelial cells along the lumen of the duct and forming a plug that blocks sweat output [A32368]. Aluminum chloride is also an astringent that promotes hemostasis; it precipitates proteins on the superficial layer of mucosa and make it mechanically stronger [A32365]. It creates superficial and local coagulation in minor hemorrhages. |When used as a deodorant, the volume of sweat produced is reduced by narrowing sweat ducts. The inhibition of body odor causing bacteria is another important strategy for deodorization [L2160]. %0A%0ABy inhibiting or deactivating odor-producing bacteria, there is little to none metabolism of sweat components thus decreasing the occurrence of body odor [L2160]. %0A%0ARecent studies suggest that the active binding of alum to the membranes of dendritic cells (DCs) result in alteration of lipid membranes structures as a key process in alum's adjuvant effect in vaccines. As new adjuvants are being developed, alum may remain as an ingredient of adjuvant combinations, or it may eventually be supplemented by other agents that more effectively provide depot and local inflammatory responses to accentuate host immune responses [L2158].|Aluminum salts plug eccrine sweat pores and forms aggregates with swear proteins that bind to the wall of the sweat duct and form a tenuous membrane [A32413].",,

Prostaglandins act (among other things) as messenger molecules in the process of inflammation.|Counter-irritation is thought to be effective at alleviating musculoskeletal pain as the irritation of the sensory nerve endings is thought to alter or offset pain in the underlying muscle or joints that are served by the same nerves [A19285]. This is thought to mask the underlying musculoskeletal pain and discomfort. When applied topically, methyl salicylate is thought to penetrate the skin and underlying tissues where it reversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase enzyme and locally and peripherally prevents the production of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin and thromboxane A2. |Salicylic acid directly irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 to decrease conversion of arachidonic acid to precursors of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. Salicylate's use in rheumatic diseases is due to it's analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity. Salicylic acid is a key ingredient in many skin-care products for the treatment of acne, psoriasis, calluses, corns, keratosis pilaris, and warts. Salicylic acid allows cells of the epidermis to more readily slough off. Because of its effect on skin cells, salicylic acid is used in several shampoos used to treat dandruff. Salicylic acid is also used as an active ingredient in gels which remove verrucas (plantar warts). Salicylic acid competitively inhibits oxidation of uridine-5-diphosphoglucose (UDPG) with nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD) and noncompetitively with UDPG. It also competitively inhibits the transferring of the glucuronyl group of uridine-5-phosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA) to a phenolic acceptor. Inhibition of mucopoly saccharide synthesis is likely responsible for the slowing of wound healing with salicylates.|Inflammation and tissue damage in different conditions including arthritis, bursitis, joint disorder, bruises, and strains or sprains of muscle origin, induce mild to moderate pain and are associated with increase prostaglandin synthesis [T28]. This is thought to be a result of COX-2 enzyme induction. COX-2 is induced in inflammatory cells in case of cell injury, infection or activation from inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Upon activation, COX-2 produces prostanoid mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and thromboxanes [T28]. Trolamine salicylate mediates its analgesic effect by inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators that sensitize nociceptive nerve endings and generate pain [T28].|Choline salicylate relieves pain by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and reduces fever by acting on the hypothalamus heat-regulating center.

Vitamin D has a major role in regulating calcium absorption from the gut, storage in mineral form in the bones, and excretion by the kidney and effectively prevents rickets in infants. Vitamin D and calcitriol can cause hypercalcemia at high or frequently repeated doses; in turn, hypercalcemia can cause kidney toxicity by accumulation of calcium-containing micro-crystals and heart and muscle dysfunction by impairing contractions. [Hybrigenics Website] The mechanism of action is currently unknown, but it is proposed that inecalcitol exerts its superagonistic action through enhancing coactivator binding by the VDR.",,

It is used together with sodium nitrite for cyanide poisiong as antidote. Cyanide has a very high affinity for iron in the ferric state. It reacts with the trivalent (ferric) iron of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase, thereby inhibiting cellular respiration, resulting in lactic acidosis and cytotoxic hypoxia. Sodium nitrite reacts with hemoglobin to form methemoglobin, which competes with cytochrome oxidase for the cyanide ion. Cyanide binds to methemoglobin to form cyanmethemoglobin and restore the activity of cytochrome oxidase. When cyanide dissociates from methemoglobin, sodium thiosulfate facilitates its conversion by rhodanese to thiocyanate, a less toxic ion. %0AAs antineoplastic adjunct: The mechanism of action of sodium thiosulfate is still not clear, but it is thought that it forms a complex with cisplastin via covalent bond, which renders cisplastin more readily eliminated from the kidneys. It was believed also that sodium thiosulfate plays a role in the protection from nephrotoxicity caused by cisplastin, through reducing delivery of cisplatin to the kidneys and by neutralizing cisplatin in the kidneys where sodium thiosulfate is highly concentrated.

As GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, this increase results in increased inhibitory activity.[A457] A possible secondary contributor to cortical inhibition is a direct suppression of voltage gated sodium channel activity and indirect suppression through effects on GABA.%0A%0AIt has also been suggested that valproate impacts the extracellular signal-related kinase pathway (ERK).[A457] These effects appear to be dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) and result in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. This activation increases expression of several downstream targets including ELK-1 with subsequent increases in c-fos, growth cone-associated protein-43 which contributes to neural plasticity, B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia-2 which is an anti-apoptotic protein, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is also involved in neural plasticity and growth. Increased neurogenesis and neurite growth due to valproate are attributed to the effects of this pathway. An additional downstream effect of increased BDNF expression appears to be an increase in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors which contribute further to increased GABAergic activity.[A177997]%0A%0AValproate exerts a non-competitive indirect inhibitory effect on myo-inosital-1-phophate synthetase.[A178000] This results in reduced de novo synthesis of inositol monophosphatase and subsequent inositol depletion. It is unknown how this contributed to valproate's effects on bipolar disorder but [lithium] is known to exert a similar inositol-depleting effect.[A178003] Valproate exposure also appears to produce down-regulation of protein kinase C proteins (PKC)-α and -ε which are potentially related to bipolar disorder as PKC is unregulated in the frontal cortex of bipolar patients. This is further supported by a similar reduction in PKC with lithium.[A178015] The inhibition of the PKC pathway may also be a contributor to migraine prophylaxis.[A178018] Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, a PKC substrate, is also downregulated by valproate and may contribute to changes in synaptic remodeling through effects on the cytoskeleton.[A178021]%0A%0AValproate also appears to impact fatty acid metabolism.[A457] Less incorporation of fatty acid substrates in sterols and glycerolipids is thought to impact membrane fluidity and result in increased action potential threshold potentially contributing to valproate's antiepileptic action.[A178024] Valproate has been found to be a non-competitive direct inhibitor of brain microsomal long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase.[A14708] Inhibition of this enzyme decreases available arichidonyl-CoA, a substrate in the production of inflammatory prostaglandins. It is thought that this may be a mechanism behind valproate's efficacy in migraine prophylaxis as migraines are routinely treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which also inhibit prostaglandin production.%0A%0AFinally, valproate acts as a direct histone deactylase (HDAC) inhibitor.[A178030] Hyperacetylation of lysine residues on histones promoted DNA relaxation and allows for increased gene transcription. The scope of valproate's genomic effects is wide with 461 genes being up or down-regulated.[A178027] The relation of these genomic effects to therapeutic value is not fully characterized however H3 and H4 hyperacetylation correlates with improvement of symptoms in bipolar patients.[A178033] Histone hyperacetylation at the BDNF gene, increasing BDNF expression, post-seizure is known to occur and is thought to be a neuroprotective mechanism which valproate may strengthen or prolong.[A178036] H3 hyperacetylation is associated with a reduction in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a pro-apoptotic enzyme, contributing further to valproate's neuroprotective effects.[A11814]",,

CBD and CBDV have been shown to dose-dependently activate and then desensitize TRPV1 as well as TRPV2 and TRPA1 channels [A31560, A33334, A32976]. Desensitization of these ion channels is a potential mechanism by which these molecules cause a reduction of neuronal hyperexcitability that contributes to epileptic activity and seizures. %0A%0ACBDV has also been shown to inhibit the activity of diacylglycerol (DAG) lipase-α, the primary synthetic enzyme of the endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) [A33296, A33347].

As GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, this increase results in increased inhibitory activity.[A457] A possible secondary contributor to cortical inhibition is a direct suppression of voltage gated sodium channel activity and indirect suppression through effects on GABA.%0A%0AIt has also been suggested that valproate impacts the extracellular signal-related kinase pathway (ERK).[A457] These effects appear to be dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) and result in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. This activation increases expression of several downstream targets including ELK-1 with subsequent increases in c-fos, growth cone-associated protein-43 which contributes to neural plasticity, B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia-2 which is an anti-apoptotic protein, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is also involved in neural plasticity and growth. Increased neurogenesis and neurite growth due to valproate are attributed to the effects of this pathway. An additional downstream effect of increased BDNF expression appears to be an increase in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors which contribute further to increased GABAergic activity.[A177997]%0A%0AValproate exerts a non-competitive indirect inhibitory effect on myo-inosital-1-phophate synthetase.[A178000] This results in reduced de novo synthesis of inositol monophosphatase and subsequent inositol depletion. It is unknown how this contributed to valproate's effects on bipolar disorder but [lithium] is known to exert a similar inositol-depleting effect.[A178003] Valproate exposure also appears to produce down-regulation of protein kinase C proteins (PKC)-α and -ε which are potentially related to bipolar disorder as PKC is unregulated in the frontal cortex of bipolar patients. This is further supported by a similar reduction in PKC with lithium.[A178015] The inhibition of the PKC pathway may also be a contributor to migraine prophylaxis.[A178018] Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, a PKC substrate, is also downregulated by valproate and may contribute to changes in synaptic remodeling through effects on the cytoskeleton.[A178021]%0A%0AValproate also appears to impact fatty acid metabolism.[A457] Less incorporation of fatty acid substrates in sterols and glycerolipids is thought to impact membrane fluidity and result in increased action potential threshold potentially contributing to valproate's antiepileptic action.[A178024] Valproate has been found to be a non-competitive direct inhibitor of brain microsomal long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase.[A14708] Inhibition of this enzyme decreases available arichidonyl-CoA, a substrate in the production of inflammatory prostaglandins. It is thought that this may be a mechanism behind valproate's efficacy in migraine prophylaxis as migraines are routinely treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which also inhibit prostaglandin production.%0A%0AFinally, valproate acts as a direct histone deactylase (HDAC) inhibitor.[A178030] Hyperacetylation of lysine residues on histones promoted DNA relaxation and allows for increased gene transcription. The scope of valproate's genomic effects is wide with 461 genes being up or down-regulated.[A178027] The relation of these genomic effects to therapeutic value is not fully characterized however H3 and H4 hyperacetylation correlates with improvement of symptoms in bipolar patients.[A178033] Histone hyperacetylation at the BDNF gene, increasing BDNF expression, post-seizure is known to occur and is thought to be a neuroprotective mechanism which valproate may strengthen or prolong.[A178036] H3 hyperacetylation is associated with a reduction in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a pro-apoptotic enzyme, contributing further to valproate's neuroprotective effects.[A11814]",,

Iodine is considered as the active moiety that mediates microbicidal actions. When released from the complex, free iodine (I2) penetrates the cell wall of microorganisms quickly, and the lethal effects are believed to result from disruption of protein and nucleic acid structure and synthesis. While the full mechanism of action is not fully elucidated, iodine is thought to inhibit vital bacterial cellular mechanisms and structures, and oxidizes nucleotides fatty or amino acids in bacterial cell membranes [A32992]. Additionally, free iodine disrupts the function of the cytosolic enzymes involved in the respiratory chain, causing them to become denatured and deactivated [A32992]. _In vitro_ evidence suggests that iodine also counteracts inflammation elicited by both pathogens and the host response via multifactorial effects. In hosts, povidone-iodine was demonstrated to modulate the redox potential, inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α and β-galactosidase, inhibit metalloproteinase production, and potentiate the healing signals from pro-inflammatory cytokines by activation of monocytes, T-lymphocytes, and macrophages, _in vitro_ [A32992].|Molecular iodine is known to inhibit the induction and promotion of N-methyl-n-nitrosourea-induced mammary carcinogenesis, to regress 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-induced breast tumors in rats.It has also been shown to have beneficial effects in fibrocystic human breast disease.",,

The liver is the critical organ for the homeostasis of copper. The copper is then prepared for excretion through the bile or incorporation into various proteins.  The transport of copper to the peripheral tissues is accomplished through the plasma attached to serum albumin, ceruloplasmin or low-molecular-weight complexes [L1829].%0A%0AIn the dermis, copper promotes dermal fibroblasts proliferation, upregulates collagen (types I, II, and V) and elastin fiber components (elastin, fibrillins) production by fibroblasts, through the induction of TGF-β, promotes heat shock protein-47, important for collagen fibril formation, serves as a cofactor of LOX enzyme required for extracellular matrix protein cross-linking, stabilizes the skin ECM once formed, as increased crosslinking of collagen and elastin matrices occurs in a copper dose dependant manner, serves as a cofactor of superoxide dismutase, an antioxidant enzyme in the skin, essential for protection against free radicals, inhibits cellular oxidative effects such as membrane damage and lipid peroxidation, acts as a cofactor of tyrosinase, a melanin biosynthesis essential enzyme responsible for skin and hair pigmentation [L1828].%0A%0AIn reference to its role as a biocide, copper is an essential nutrient for many organisms. It acts as a cofactor in respiration, and therefore copper is required for aerobic metabolism. Accumulation of copper ions or intracellular release of free copper ions from proteins lead to cell damage. Copper catalyzes reactions that result in the production of hydroxyl radicals through the Fenton and Haber-Weiss reactions. The highly reactive oxygen intermediates lead to lipid peroxidation and oxidation of proteins.

FECH is required to insert iron into protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) to generate heme, and a deficiency in FECH results in accumulation of PPIX (particularly in the liver and superficial skin vasculature). PPIX molecules are photodynamic - exposure to UV radiation causes these molecules to form reactive oxygen species that lead to subsequent tissue damage.[A187199]%0A%0AAfamelanotide mimics endogenous alpha melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), a hormone typically released in response to UV-induced skin damage. Both afamelanotide and α-MSH bind to the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) on melanocytes which stimulates the synthesis of eumelanin, a photoprotective compound. Eumelanin is incorporated into small vesicles called melanosomes which are then distributed to surrounding keratinocytes. Melanosomes are concentrated above the nucleus of these keratinocytes, thus protecting them from UV-induced damage.[A187202] While endogenous α-MSH requires UV-induced skin damage in order to be produced, afamelanotide increases eumelanin biosynthesis independent of UV exposure.[A187205]%0A%0AActivation of MC1R signalling by afamelanotide also instigates other protective processes, including an increase in antioxidant activity, DNA repair, and secretion of immunomodulatory proteins such as interleukin-10.[A187202]",,

It is possible that Li+ produces its effects by interacting with the transport of monovalent or divalent cations in neurons. An increasing number of scientists have come to the conclusion that the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is the key factor in understanding how lithium works. Lithium has been shown to change the inward and outward currents of glutamate receptors (especially GluR3), without a shift in reversal potential. Lithium has been found to exert a dual effect on glutamate receptors, acting to keep the amount of glutamate active between cells at a stable, healthy level, neither too much nor too little.  It is postulated that too much glutamate in the space between neurons causes mania, and too little, depression. Another mechanism by which lithium might help to regulate mood include the non-competitive inhibition of an enzyme called inositol monophosphatase.  Alternately lithium's action may be enhanced through the deactivation of the GSK-3B enzyme.  The regulation of GSK-3B by lithium may affect the circadian clock.  GSK-3 is known for phosphorylating and thus inactivating glycogen synthase. GSK-3B has also been implicated in the control of cellular response to damaged DNA. GSK-3 normally phosphorylates beta catenin, which leads to beta catenin degratation. When GSK-3 is inhibited, beta catenin increases and transgenic mice with overexpression of beta catenin express similar behaviour to mice treated with lithium. These results suggest that increase of beta catenin may be a possible pathway for the therapeutic action of lithium. |Lithium's mechanism of action is still unknown[FDA Label]. However, the “inositol depletion theory” suggests 3 main potential targets[A176642]. These targets are inositol monophosphatase, inositol polyphosphatase, and glycogen synthase kinase 3(GSK-3)[A176642,L5843].%0A%0AThe “Inositol depletion theory” suggests lithium behaves as an uncompetitive inhibitor of inositol monophosphatase in a manner inversely proportional to the degree of stimulus[A176642]. This inhibition lowers levels of inositol triphosphate[L5843]. However, stronger inhibitors of inositol monophosphatase are not as clinically effective and low levels of inositol triphosphate are associated with memory impairment[A176642,L5843].%0A%0ALithium acts on inositol polyphosphatase as an uncompetitive inhibitor[A176642]. This inhibition is thought to have multiple downstream effects that have yet to be clarified[A176642].%0A%0ALithium regulates phosphorylation of GSK-3 which regulates other enzymes through phosphorylation[A176642]. Lithium can also inhibit GSK-3 through interfering with the magnesium ion in the active site[A176642].",,

The DLCO depends not only on the area and thickness of the blood-gas barrier but additionally on the volume of blood in the pulmonary capillaries. The distribution of alveolar volume and ventilation also has an impact on the measurement [L2558].%0A%0ADLCO is measured by sampling end-expiratory gas for carbon monoxide (CO) after patients inspire a small and safe amount of exogenous CO, hold their breath, and exhale. Measured DLCO is adjusted for alveolar volume (which is estimated from dilution of helium) and the patient’s hematocrit level. DLCO is reported as mL/min/mm Hg and as a percentage of a predicted value [A32759].%0A%0ACarbon monoxide exerts effects on cell metabolism through both hypoxic and non-hypoxic modes of action. Both mechanisms of action are thought to be the result of the ability of carbon monoxide to bind strongly to heme and alter the function and/or metabolism of heme proteins. The binding affinity of carbon monoxide for hemoglobin is more than 200 times greater than that of oxygen for hemoglobin. The formation of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) decreases the O2 carrying capacity of blood and disrupts the release of O2 from Hb for its use in tissues. Through similar mechanisms, carbon monoxide diminishes the O2 storage in muscle cells by binding to and displacing O2 from, myoglobin. Though all human tissues are vulnerable to carbon monoxide-induced hypoxic injury, those with the highest O2 demand are especially vulnerable, including the brain and heart [L2550].%0A%0AMost of the non-hypoxic mechanisms of action of carbon monoxide have been thought to be due to binding of carbon monoxide to heme in proteins other than Hb. The most notable targets of carbon monoxide include components of many important physiological regulatory systems, including brain and muscle oxygen storage and use(myoglobin, neuroglobin); nitric oxide cell signaling  (e.g., nitric oxide synthase, guanylyl cyclase); prostaglandin cell signaling (cyclooxygenase, prostaglandin H synthase); energy metabolism and mitochondrial respiration (cytochrome c oxidase, cytochrome c, NADPH oxidase); steroid and drug metabolism (cytochrome P450); cellular redox balance and reactive oxygen species (ROS; catalase, peroxidases); and numerous transcription factors (e.g., neuronal PAS domain protein, NPAS2, implicated in regulation of circadian rhythm) [L2550].%0A%0AIn meat processing, carbon monoxide reacts with myoglobin, to form carboxymyoglobin, imparting a red appearance to the meat [L2540].%0A",,

The liver is the critical organ for the homeostasis of copper. The copper is then prepared for excretion through the bile or incorporation into various proteins.  The transport of copper to the peripheral tissues is accomplished through the plasma attached to serum albumin, ceruloplasmin or low-molecular-weight complexes [L1829].%0A%0AIn the dermis, copper promotes dermal fibroblasts proliferation, upregulates collagen (types I, II, and V) and elastin fiber components (elastin, fibrillins) production by fibroblasts, through the induction of TGF-β, promotes heat shock protein-47, important for collagen fibril formation, serves as a cofactor of LOX enzyme required for extracellular matrix protein cross-linking, stabilizes the skin ECM once formed, as increased crosslinking of collagen and elastin matrices occurs in a copper dose dependant manner, serves as a cofactor of superoxide dismutase, an antioxidant enzyme in the skin, essential for protection against free radicals, inhibits cellular oxidative effects such as membrane damage and lipid peroxidation, acts as a cofactor of tyrosinase, a melanin biosynthesis essential enzyme responsible for skin and hair pigmentation [L1828].%0A%0AIn reference to its role as a biocide, copper is an essential nutrient for many organisms. It acts as a cofactor in respiration, and therefore copper is required for aerobic metabolism. Accumulation of copper ions or intracellular release of free copper ions from proteins lead to cell damage. Copper catalyzes reactions that result in the production of hydroxyl radicals through the Fenton and Haber-Weiss reactions. The highly reactive oxygen intermediates lead to lipid peroxidation and oxidation of proteins. Free copper ions oxidize sulfhydryl groups, such as cysteine, in proteins or the cellular redox buffer glutathione.

The concentration differences of these charged particles causes a difference in electric potential between the inside and outside of cells, known as the membrane potential. The balance between potassium and sodium is maintained by ion pumps in the cell membrane. The cell membrane potential created by potassium and sodium ions allows the cell generate an action potential—a ""spike"" of electrical discharge. The ability of cells to produce electrical discharge is critical for body functions such as neurotransmission, muscle contraction, and heart function.

Vitamin D and calcitriol can cause hypercalcemia at high or frequently repeated doses; in turn, hypercalcemia can cause kidney toxicity by accumulation of calcium-containing micro-crystals and heart and muscle dysfunction by impairing contractions.

However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects of methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.",,

JAKs are tyrosine kinases that cause phosphorylation of several proteins, including cytokine receptors and JAKs themselves. Phosphorylation of JAKs promotes the phosphorylation and activation of the signalling molecules called STATs, leading to their nuclear translocation, binding to DNA promoters, and target gene transcription. JAK1-mediated signalling pathways ultimately promote pro-inflammatory events, such as increased proliferation and survival of immune cells, T cell differentiation, and macrophage activation.[A189168] Upadacitinib is a selective JAK1 inhibitor that has a negligible effect on JAK3, leading to an improved drug safety profile.[A189165] Upadacitinib blocks the cellular processes that contribute to the inflammatory conditions in rheumatoid arthritis. In human leukocytes cellular assays, upadacitinib inhibited JAK1/3-induced phosphorylation of STAT3/5 mediated by IL-6/7.[L10896]",,

FECH is required to insert iron into protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) to generate heme, and a deficiency in FECH results in accumulation of PPIX (particularly in the liver and superficial skin vasculature). PPIX molecules are photodynamic - exposure to UV radiation causes these molecules to form reactive oxygen species that lead to subsequent tissue damage.[A187199]%0A%0AAfamelanotide mimics endogenous alpha melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), a hormone typically released in response to UV-induced skin damage. Both afamelanotide and α-MSH bind to the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) on melanocytes which stimulates the synthesis of eumelanin, a photoprotective compound. Eumelanin is incorporated into small vesicles called melanosomes which are then distributed to surrounding keratinocytes. Melanosomes are concentrated above the nucleus of these keratinocytes, thus protecting them from UV-induced damage.[A187202] While endogenous α-MSH requires UV-induced skin damage in order to be produced, afamelanotide increases eumelanin biosynthesis independent of UV exposure.[A187205]%0A%0AActivation of MC1R signalling by afamelanotide also instigates other protective processes, including an increase in antioxidant activity, DNA repair, and secretion of immunomodulatory proteins such as interleukin-10.[A187202]",,

CBD and CBDV have been shown to dose-dependently activate and then desensitize TRPV1 as well as TRPV2 and TRPA1 channels [A31560, A33334, A32976]. Desensitization of these ion channels is a potential mechanism by which these molecules cause a reduction of neuronal hyperexcitability that contributes to epileptic activity and seizures. %0A%0ACBDV has also been shown to inhibit the activity of diacylglycerol (DAG) lipase-α, the primary synthetic enzyme of the endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) [A33296, A33347].

The DLCO depends not only on the area and thickness of the blood-gas barrier but additionally on the volume of blood in the pulmonary capillaries. The distribution of alveolar volume and ventilation also has an impact on the measurement [L2558].%0A%0ADLCO is measured by sampling end-expiratory gas for carbon monoxide (CO) after patients inspire a small and safe amount of exogenous CO, hold their breath, and exhale. Measured DLCO is adjusted for alveolar volume (which is estimated from dilution of helium) and the patient’s hematocrit level. DLCO is reported as mL/min/mm Hg and as a percentage of a predicted value [A32759].%0A%0ACarbon monoxide exerts effects on cell metabolism through both hypoxic and non-hypoxic modes of action. Both mechanisms of action are thought to be the result of the ability of carbon monoxide to bind strongly to heme and alter the function and/or metabolism of heme proteins. The binding affinity of carbon monoxide for hemoglobin is more than 200 times greater than that of oxygen for hemoglobin. The formation of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) decreases the O2 carrying capacity of blood and disrupts the release of O2 from Hb for its use in tissues. Through similar mechanisms, carbon monoxide diminishes the O2 storage in muscle cells by binding to and displacing O2 from, myoglobin. Though all human tissues are vulnerable to carbon monoxide-induced hypoxic injury, those with the highest O2 demand are especially vulnerable, including the brain and heart [L2550].%0A%0AMost of the non-hypoxic mechanisms of action of carbon monoxide have been thought to be due to binding of carbon monoxide to heme in proteins other than Hb. The most notable targets of carbon monoxide include components of many important physiological regulatory systems, including brain and muscle oxygen storage and use(myoglobin, neuroglobin); nitric oxide cell signaling  (e.g., nitric oxide synthase, guanylyl cyclase); prostaglandin cell signaling (cyclooxygenase, prostaglandin H synthase); energy metabolism and mitochondrial respiration (cytochrome c oxidase, cytochrome c, NADPH oxidase); steroid and drug metabolism (cytochrome P450); cellular redox balance and reactive oxygen species (ROS; catalase, peroxidases); and numerous transcription factors (e.g., neuronal PAS domain protein, NPAS2, implicated in regulation of circadian rhythm) [L2550].%0A%0AIn meat processing, carbon monoxide reacts with myoglobin, to form carboxymyoglobin, imparting a red appearance to the meat [L2540].%0A",,

Oxygen plays a critical role as an electron acceptor during oxidative phosphorylation in the electron transport chain through activation of cytochrome c oxidase (terminal enzyme of the electron transport chain). This process achieves successful aerobic respiration in organisms to generate ATP molecules as an energy source in many tissues. Oxygen supplementation acts to restore normal cellular activity at the mitochondrial level and reduce metabolic acidosis. There is also evidence that oxygen may interact with O2-sensitive voltage-gated potassium channels in glomus cells and cause hyperpolarization of mitochondrial membrane [A19120]. ",,

JAKs are tyrosine kinases that cause phosphorylation of several proteins, including cytokine receptors and JAKs themselves. Phosphorylation of JAKs promotes the phosphorylation and activation of the signalling molecules called STATs, leading to their nuclear translocation, binding to DNA promoters, and target gene transcription. JAK1-mediated signalling pathways ultimately promote pro-inflammatory events, such as increased proliferation and survival of immune cells, T cell differentiation, and macrophage activation.[A189168] Upadacitinib is a selective JAK1 inhibitor that has a negligible effect on JAK3, leading to an improved drug safety profile.[A189165] Upadacitinib blocks the cellular processes that contribute to the inflammatory conditions in rheumatoid arthritis. In human leukocytes cellular assays, upadacitinib inhibited JAK1/3-induced phosphorylation of STAT3/5 mediated by IL-6/7.[L10896]",,

NO is produced by all tissues of the body and plays very important roles in the cardiovascular system, immune system and nervous system. NO is formed from L-arginine via the enzyme nitric oxide synthase or synthetase (NOS), and the effects of NO are mainly mediated by 3,'5' -cyclic guanylate or cyclic GMP. NO activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic GMP from guanosine triphosphate or GTP. Cyclic GMP is converted to guanylic acid via the enzyme cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. NOS is a heme-containing enzyme with some sequences similar to cytochrome P-450 reductase. Several isoforms of NOS exist, two of which are constitutive and one of which is inducible by immunological stimuli. The constitutive NOS found in the vascular endothelium is designated eNOS and that present in the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system is designated nNOS. The form of NOS induced by immunological or inflammatory stimuli is known as iNOS. iNOS may be expressed constitutively in select tissues such as lung epithelium. All the nitric oxide synthases use NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and oxygen (O2) as cosubstrates, as well as the cofactors FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide), FMN (flavin mononucleotide), tetrahydrobiopterin and heme. Interestingly, ascorbic acid appears to enhance NOS activity by increasing intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin. eNOS and nNOS synthesize NO in response to an increased concentration of calcium ions or in some cases in response to calcium-independent stimuli, such as shear stress. In vitro studies of NOS indicate that the Km of the enzyme for L-arginine is in the micromolar range. The concentration of L-arginine in endothelial cells, as well as in other cells, and in plasma is in the millimolar range. What this means is that, under physiological conditions, NOS is saturated with its L-arginine substrate. In other words, L-arginine would not be expected to be rate-limiting for the enzyme, and it would not appear that supraphysiological levels of L-arginine which could occur with oral supplementation of the amino acid^would make any difference with regard to NO production. The reaction would appear to have reached its maximum level. However, in vivo studies have demonstrated that, under certain conditions, e.g. hypercholesterolemia, supplemental L-arginine could enhance endothelial-dependent vasodilation and NO production.",,

The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].%0A%0AZinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].%0A%0AIn HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].%0A%0AThere are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].%0A%0AZinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A342417].%0A%0AThe change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A3424]. %0A%0AIn humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].%0A%0AIn another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A3424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].%0A%0AThe exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].|Although the mechanism of action is not completely known, zinc supplementation may be used to increase immunity against viruses or may interfere with the replication of certain viruses, such as the human papillomavirus (HPV) [L2080].%0A%0A|Undecylenic acid demonstrated effectiveness against _Candida albicans_, which is an opportunistic pathogenic yeast with two cellular morphologies: the round yeast form and the filamentous form with elongated hyphae. Hyphae formation is associated with active infections and virulence [A32286]. A study proposed that undecylenic acid inhibits biofilm formation of _Candida albicans_ with optimal concentration above 3 mM and disrupts hyphal growth, which is the morphological transition from yeast to filamentous phase, at concentration above 4 mM [A32284]. Under the drug treatment, hyphal formation related genes, like HWP1, were significantly reduced in transcriptional level leading to poor biofilm formation [A32284]. Both biofilm and hyphae formation are critical virulence factors for the initiation of skin infection and late development of disseminated infection [A32284]. Undecylenic acid may also inhibit enzyme involved in lipid metabolism and abolish germ tube formation by carrying protons across the plasma membrane, thus altering cytoplasmic pH [A32286].|Zinc inhibits cAMP-induced, chloride-dependent fluid secretion by inhibiting basolateral potassium (K) channels, in in-vitro studies with rat ileum. This study has also shown the specificity of Zn to cAMP-activated K channels, because zinc did not block the calcium (Ca)-mediated K channels. As this study was not performed in Zn-deficient animals, it provides evidence that Zn is probably effective in the absence of Zn deficiency.  Zinc also improves the absorption of water and electrolytes, improves regeneration of the intestinal epithelium, increases the levels of brush border enzymes, and enhances the immune response, allowing for a better clearance of the pathogens.|It acts by providing a physical barrier to prevent skin irritation and help heal damaged skin.|Glucarpidase inactivates methotrexate, and other antifolates, by hydrolyzing glutamate on the carboxyl terminal of these compounds.

As GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, this increase results in increased inhibitory activity.[A457] A possible secondary contributor to cortical inhibition is a direct suppression of voltage gated sodium channel activity and indirect suppression through effects on GABA.%0A%0AIt has also been suggested that valproate impacts the extracellular signal-related kinase pathway (ERK).[A457] These effects appear to be dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) and result in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. This activation increases expression of several downstream targets including ELK-1 with subsequent increases in c-fos, growth cone-associated protein-43 which contributes to neural plasticity, B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia-2 which is an anti-apoptotic protein, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is also involved in neural plasticity and growth. Increased neurogenesis and neurite growth due to valproate are attributed to the effects of this pathway. An additional downstream effect of increased BDNF expression appears to be an increase in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors which contribute further to increased GABAergic activity.[A177997]%0A%0AValproate exerts a non-competitive indirect inhibitory effect on myo-inosital-1-phophate synthetase.[A178000] This results in reduced de novo synthesis of inositol monophosphatase and subsequent inositol depletion. It is unknown how this contributed to valproate's effects on bipolar disorder but [lithium] is known to exert a similar inositol-depleting effect.[A178003] Valproate exposure also appears to produce down-regulation of protein kinase C proteins (PKC)-α and -ε which are potentially related to bipolar disorder as PKC is unregulated in the frontal cortex of bipolar patients. This is further supported by a similar reduction in PKC with lithium.[A178015] The inhibition of the PKC pathway may also be a contributor to migraine prophylaxis.[A178018] Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, a PKC substrate, is also downregulated by valproate and may contribute to changes in synaptic remodeling through effects on the cytoskeleton.[A178021]%0A%0AValproate also appears to impact fatty acid metabolism.[A457] Less incorporation of fatty acid substrates in sterols and glycerolipids is thought to impact membrane fluidity and result in increased action potential threshold potentially contributing to valproate's antiepileptic action.[A178024] Valproate has been found to be a non-competitive direct inhibitor of brain microsomal long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase.[A14708] Inhibition of this enzyme decreases available arichidonyl-CoA, a substrate in the production of inflammatory prostaglandins. It is thought that this may be a mechanism behind valproate's efficacy in migraine prophylaxis as migraines are routinely treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which also inhibit prostaglandin production.%0A%0AFinally, valproate acts as a direct histone deactylase (HDAC) inhibitor.[A178030] Hyperacetylation of lysine residues on histones promoted DNA relaxation and allows for increased gene transcription. The scope of valproate's genomic effects is wide with 461 genes being up or down-regulated.[A178027] The relation of these genomic effects to therapeutic value is not fully characterized however H3 and H4 hyperacetylation correlates with improvement of symptoms in bipolar patients.[A178033] Histone hyperacetylation at the BDNF gene, increasing BDNF expression, post-seizure is known to occur and is thought to be a neuroprotective mechanism which valproate may strengthen or prolong.[A178036] H3 hyperacetylation is associated with a reduction in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a pro-apoptotic enzyme, contributing further to valproate's neuroprotective effects.[A11814]",,

The consequences of _C. difficile_ infection can be mild to severe and sometimes fatal.[A190492] %0A%0AFidaxomicin gets hydrolyzed to its active metabolite, OP-1118, upon oral administration. Both compounds mediate a bactericidal activity against _C. difficile_ by inhibiting bacterial RNA polymerase at the initiation phase of the transcription cycle.[A190486] The RNA polymerase is an essential bacterial enzyme that regulates gene expression, catalyzes nucleic acid interactions, and promotes several bacterial enzymatic reactions critical for bacterial survival.[A190486] The core RNA polymerase is composed of a complex of different subunits and contains the active site.[A190531] To initiate bacterial transcription, the active site of the core RNA polymerase binds to a promoter-specificity σ initiation factor, which locates and binds to a promoter region of the DNA. The DNA-RNA polymerase interaction promotes subsequent steps of transcription, which involves the separation of DNA strands.[A7444] Fidaxomicin binds to the DNA template-RNA polymerase complex, thereby preventing the initial separation of DNA strands during transcription and inhibiting messenger RNA synthesis.[A190486] The narrow spectrum of antimicrobial activity of fidaxomicin may be explained by the unique target site of fidaxomicin and differing σ subunits of the core structure of RNA polymerase among bacterial species.[A190486] ",,RNA polymerase inhibitor

Box 9001,Hampton,New Jersey,8827,United States,241807,FALSE,,,7U1EE4V452,,,,,,,,"%0AIn respiratory testing, the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is a measure of the ability of gas to transfer from the alveoli across the alveolar epithelium and the capillary endothelium to the red blood cells. The DLCO depends not only on the area and thickness of the blood-gas barrier but additionally on the volume of blood in the pulmonary capillaries. The distribution of alveolar volume and ventilation also has an impact on the measurement [L2558].%0A%0ADLCO is measured by sampling end-expiratory gas for carbon monoxide (CO) after patients inspire a small and safe amount of exogenous CO, hold their breath, and exhale. Measured DLCO is adjusted for alveolar volume (which is estimated from dilution of helium) and the patient’s hematocrit level. DLCO is reported as mL/min/mm Hg and as a percentage of a predicted value [A32759].%0A%0ACarbon monoxide exerts effects on cell metabolism through both hypoxic and non-hypoxic modes of action. Both mechanisms of action are thought to be the result of the ability of carbon monoxide to bind strongly to heme and alter the function and/or metabolism of heme proteins. The binding affinity of carbon monoxide for hemoglobin is more than 200 times greater than that of oxygen for hemoglobin. The formation of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) decreases the O2 carrying capacity of blood and disrupts the release of O2 from Hb for its use in tissues. Through similar mechanisms, carbon monoxide diminishes the O2 storage in muscle cells by binding to and displacing O2 from, myoglobin. Though all human tissues are vulnerable to carbon monoxide-induced hypoxic injury, those with the highest O2 demand are especially vulnerable, including the brain and heart [L2550].%0A%0AMost of the non-hypoxic mechanisms of action of carbon monoxide have been thought to be due to binding of carbon monoxide to heme in proteins other than Hb. The most notable targets of carbon monoxide include components of many important physiological regulatory systems, including brain and muscle oxygen storage and use(myoglobin, neuroglobin); nitric oxide cell signaling  (e.g., nitric oxide synthase, guanylyl cyclase); prostaglandin cell signaling (cyclooxygenase, prostaglandin H synthase); energy metabolism and mitochondrial respiration (cytochrome c oxidase, cytochrome c, NADPH oxidase); steroid and drug metabolism (cytochrome P450); cellular redox balance and reactive oxygen species (ROS; catalase, peroxidases); and numerous transcription factors (e.g., neuronal PAS domain protein, NPAS2, implicated in regulation of circadian rhythm) [L2550].%0A%0AIn meat processing, carbon monoxide reacts with myoglobin, to form carboxymyoglobin, imparting a red appearance to the meat [L2540].%0A",,

Metformin decreases blood glucose levels by decreasing hepatic glucose production (gluconeogenesis), decreasing the intestinal absorption of glucose, and increasing insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization [FDA label]. It is well established that metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity, and it has since been generally postulated that its potent antidiabetic effects occur through this mechanism [A36534, A36557].   The above processes lead to a decrease in blood glucose, managing type II diabetes and exerting positive effects on glycemic control.%0A%0AAfter ingestion, the organic cation transporter-1 (OCT1) is responsible for the uptake of metformin into hepatocytes (liver cells). As this drug is positively charged, it accumulates in cells and in the mitochondria because of the membrane potentials across the plasma membrane as well as the mitochondrial inner membrane. Metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I, preventing the production of mitochondrial ATP leading to increased cytoplasmic ADP:ATP and AMP:ATP ratios [A36534]. These changes activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an enzyme that plays an important role in the regulation of glucose metabolism [A176348]. Aside from this mechanism, AMPK can be activated by a lysosomal mechanism involving other activators.  Following this process, increases in AMP:ATP ratio also inhibit _fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase_ enzyme, resulting in the inhibition of gluconeogenesis, while also inhibiting _adenylate cyclase_ and decreasing the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) [A36534], a derivative of ATP used for cell signaling [A176351]. Activated AMPK phosphorylates two isoforms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme, thereby inhibiting fat synthesis and leading to fat oxidation, reducing hepatic lipid stores and increasing liver sensitivity to insulin [A36534].  %0A%0AIn the intestines, metformin increases anaerobic glucose metabolism in enterocytes (intestinal cells), leading to reduced net glucose uptake and increased delivery of lactate to the liver. Recent studies have also implicated the gut as a primary site of action of metformin and suggest that the liver may not be as important for metformin action in patients with type 2 diabetes. Some of the ways metformin may play a role on the intestines is by promoting the metabolism of glucose by increasing glucagon-like peptide I (GLP-1) as well as increasing gut utilization of glucose  [A36534]. %0A%0AIn addition to the above pathway, the mechanism of action of metformin may be explained by other ways, and its exact mechanism of action has been under extensive study in recent years [A36535, A36554, A36555, A36557].",ACACB|PRKAB1|INS,insulin sensitizer

Experimental evidence also suggests that a sulfhydryl-containing compound such as acetylcysteine may also directly inactivate the metabolite. The mechanisms of action for acetylcysteine’s well-known mucolytic effects are different.  In particular, when inhaled, acetylcysteine (and its metabolic byproduct cysteine) exerts its mucolytic action through its free sulfhydryl group, which reduces the disulfide bonds in the mucus matrix and lowers mucus viscosity. This action increases with increasing pH and is most significant at pH 7 to 9. The mucolytic action of acetylcysteine is not affected by the presence of DNA. Acetylcysteine is also an antioxidant and reduces oxidative stress. Acetylcysteine serves as a prodrug to L-cysteine which is a precursor to the biologic antioxidant, glutathione and hence administration of acetylcysteine replenishes glutathione stores. L-cysteine also serves as a precursor to cystine which in turn serves as a substrate for the cystine-glutamate antiporter on astrocytes hence increasing glutamate release into the extracellular space. This glutamate in turn acts on mGluR2/3 receptors, and at higher doses of acetylcysteine, mGluR5. Glutathione also modulates the NMDA receptor by acting at the redox site. These effects on glutamate and NMDA signaling appear to explain some of the positive neuropsychotropic effects associated with NAC.  Acetylcysteine also possesses some anti-inflammatory effects possibly via inhibiting NF-κB through redox activation of the nuclear factor kappa kinases thereby modulating cytokine synthesis.",GRIN1|GRIN3A|GRIN2D|GRIN2B|GRIN2A|RELA|IKBKB|SLC7A11|ACY1|GSS|CHUK,mucolytic agent

It is non-selective for COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Inhibition of COX-1 results in the inhibition of platelet aggregation for about 7-10 days (average platelet lifespan). The acetyl group of acetylsalicylic acid binds with a serine residue of the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme, leading to irreversible inhibition. This prevents the production of pain-causing prostaglandins. This process also stops the conversion of arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which is a potent inducer of platelet aggregation [FDA label].  Platelet aggregation can result in clots and harmful venous and arterial thromboembolism, leading to conditions such as pulmonary embolism and stroke. %0A%0AIt is important to note that there is 60% homology between the protein structures of COX-1 and COX-2. ASA binds to serine 516 residue on the active site of COX-2 in the same fashion as its binding to the serine 530 residue located on the active site of COX-1. The active site of COX-2 is, however, slightly larger than the active site of COX-1, so that arachidonic acid (which later becomes prostaglandins) manages to bypass the aspirin molecule inactivating COX-2 [A32682, A177256].  ASA, therefore, exerts more action on the COX-1 receptor rather than on the COX-2 receptor [A177268]. A higher dose of acetylsalicylic acid is required for COX-2 inhibition [A177325].

While the exact mechanism of action is not certain, theories exist as to how artemisinins produce their antimalarial effect.%0A%0AArtemisinins are believed to bind to haem within the *P. falciparum* parasite [A31564, A31588]. The source of this haem varies with the life stage of the parasite. When the parasite is in the early ring stage artemisinins are believed to bind haem produced by the parasite's haem biosynthesis pathway. In later stages artemisinins likely bind to haem released by haemoglobin digestion. Once bound to haem, artemisinins are thought to undergo activation involving ferrous iron via reductive scission which splits the endoperoxide bridge to produce a reactive oxygen [A31587, A31596]. This reactive oxygen is thought to undergo a subsequent intramolecular hydrogen abstraction to produce a reactive carbon radical [A31596]. The carbon radical is believed to be the source of the drugs potent activity against *P. falciparum* by alkylating a wide array of protein targets [A20257, A31564, A31596]. The nature and magnitude of the effect on specific protein function as a result of this alkylation is unknown.%0A%0AOne target which has been the focus of research is the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase pump of *P. falciparum* [A31594]. Artemisinins have been found to irreversably bind to and inhibit this protein at a binding site similar to that of Thapsigargin. The mechanism is likely the same as for other proteins, namely alkylation via the carbon radical intermediate.%0A%0AArtemisinins appear to preferentially collect in infected erythrocytes, concentrating the drug by several hundred-fold compared to uninfected cells [A31597]. This may play a role in why little alkylation is seen in uninfected erythrocytes [A31595].",,antimalarial agent

Once it has entered the cell it is hydrolyzed to its active form which complexes with water molecules [A20304]. This form binds to to nucleophiles in the cytoplasm such as glutathione and other cyteine rich proteins resulting in an overall increase in oxidative stress as the cell loses antioxidant proteins. It also binds to purine nucleotides in the DNA. The active form allows for two binding interactions to form cross-links between these nucleotides. High mobility group proteins-1 and -2 induce apoptosis in response to guanine cross-links and their binding serves to shield the cross-linked DNA from repair mechanisms. The mismatch repair (MMR) protein complex also recognizes the distortion caused by platinum complexes and attempts to repair the DNA. This results in single strand breaks when the MMR complex attempts to remove the platinum cross-link. The MMR complex induces apoptosis after the repair attempt has failed. The single strand break in DNA makes it easier to form lethal double strand breaks with radiation treatment thus creating the radiosensitizing effect of nedaplatin [A20303].",,DNA inhibitor

Paramagnetic agents have unpaired electrons that generate a magnetic field about 700 times larger than the proton's field, thus disturbing the proton's local magnetic field. When the local magnetic field around a proton is disturbed, its relaxation process is altered. MR images are based on proton density and proton relaxation dynamics. MR instruments can record 2 different relaxation processes, the T1 (spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation time) and the T2 (spin-spin or transverse relaxation time). In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), visualization of normal and pathological brain tissue depends in part on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity that occur with changes in proton density, alteration of the T1, and variation in the T2. When placed in a magnetic field, gadodiamide shortens both the T1 and the T2 relaxation times in tissues where it accumulates. At clinical doses, gadodiamide primarily affects the T1 relaxation time, thus producing an increase in signal intensity. Gadodiamide does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier; therefore, it does not accumulate in normal brain tissue or in central nervous system (CNS) lesions that have not caused an abnormal blood-brain barrier (e.g., cysts, mature post-operative scars). Abnormal vascularity or disruption of the blood-brain barrier allows accumulation of gadodiamide in lesions such as neoplasms, abscesses, and subacute infarcts.",,radiopaque medium

This effect can be beneficial, however, as dose-related side effects such as respiratory depression, sedation, and intoxication also plateau at around 32mg, resulting in a lower risk of overdose compared to [methadone] and other full agonist opioids.[A186215,A186218] It also means that opioid-dependent patients do not experience sedation or euphoria at the same rate that they might experience with more potent opioids, improving quality of life for patients with severe pain and reducing the reinforcing effects of opioids which can lead to drug-seeking behaviours.[A186280]%0A%0ABuprenorphine's high affinity, but low intrinsic activity for the mu-opioid receptor also means that if it is started in opioid-dependent individuals, it will displace the other opioids without creating an equal opioid effect and cause a phenomenon known as ""precipitated withdrawal"" which is characterized by a rapid and intense onset of withdrawal symptoms (i.e. anxiety, restlessness, gastrointestinal distress, diaphoresis, intense drug cravings, and tachycardia). Individuals must therefore be in a state of mild to moderate withdrawal before starting therapy with buprenorphine. %0A%0ABuprenorphine is commercially available as the brand name product Suboxone which is formulated in a 4:1 fixed-dose combination product along with [naloxone], a non-selective competitive opioid receptor antagonist. Combination of an opioid agonist with an opioid antagonist may seem counterintuitive, however this combination with naloxone is intended to reduce the abuse potential of Suboxone, as naloxone is poorly absorbed by the oral route (and has no effect when taken orally), but would reverse the opioid agonist effects of buprenorphine if injected intravenously.[A186289,F4715,F4718] ",,Agonist–antagonist opioid receptor modulator

Its role in potentiating insulin signalling cascades has been implicated in several studies. Chromium upregulates insulin-stimulated insulin signal transduction via affecting effector molecules downstream of the insulin receptor (IR). IR-mediated signalling pathway involves phoshorylation of multiple intracellular domains and protein kinases, and downstream effector molecules [A32353]. Upon activation by ligands, intracellular β-subunit of IR autophosphorylates and activates tyrosine kinase domain of the IR, followed by activation and phosphorylation of regulatory proteins and downstream signalling effectors including phosphatidylinositol 2-kinase (PI3K). PI3K activates further downstream reaction cascades to activate protein kinase B (Akt) to ultimately promote translocation of glucose transporter-4 (Glut4)-vesicles from the cytoplasm to the cell surface and regulate glucose uptake [A32353]. Chromium enhances the kinase activity of insulin receptor β and increases the activity of downstream effectors, pI3-kinase and Akt. %0A%0AUnder insulin-resistant conditions, chromium also promotes GLUT-4 transporter translocation that is independent of activity of IR, IRS-1, PI3-kinase, or Akt; chromium mediates cholesterol efflux from the membranes via increasing fluidity of the membrane by decreasing the membrane cholesterol and upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein [A32353]. As a result, intracellular GLUT-4 transporters are stimulated to translocate from intracellular to the plasma membrane, leading to enhanced glucose uptake in muscle cells [L1990]. Chromium attenuates the activity of PTP-1B _in vitro,_ which is a negative regulator of insulin signaling. It also alleviates ER stress that is observed to be elevated the suppression of insulin signaling. ER stress is thought to activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which subsequently induces serine phosphorylation of IRS and aberration of insulin signalling [A32353]. Transient upregulation of AMPK by chromium also leads to increased glucose uptake [A32353]. |Metallic chromium has no biological activity. Chromium is referred as a glucose tolerance factor. This glucose tolerance factor is a complex of molecules. Glycine, cysteine, glutamic acid and nicotinic acid along with chromium form this complex.",,

Although the exact mechanism of action has not been fully determined, evidence shows that cladribine is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase to the nucleotidecladribine triphosphate (CdATP; 2-chloro-2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate), which accumulates and is incorporated into DNA in cells such as lymphocytes that contain high levels of deoxycytidine kinase and low levels of deoxynucleotidase, resulting in DNA strand breakage and inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair. High levels of CdATP also appear to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, which leads to an imbalance in triphosphorylated deoxynucleotide (dNTP) pools and subsequent DNA strand breaks, inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and ATP depletion, and cell death. Unlike other antimetabolite drugs, cladribine has cytotoxic effects on resting as well as proliferating lymphocytes. However, it does cause cells to accumulate at the G1/S phase junction, suggesting that cytotoxicity is associated with events critical to cell entry into S phase.

However, resistance mutations have now been observed in pUL51, pUL56, and pUL89 [A31291].

In particular, benzydamine predominantly acts by inhibiting the synthesis of pro inflammatory cytokines like tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) without largely affecting other pro inflammatory cytokines (ie. such as IL-6 and IL-8) or anti-inflammatory cytokines (ie. like IL-10 or IL-1 receptor antagonist). [A31528, L1120]%0A%0AMoreover, benzydamine is largely a weak inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis as it has been shown to effectively inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase enzyme activity only at concentrations of 1mM or greater. Considering most contemporary usages of benzydamine are topical applications that are generally not well absorbed through the skin and/or non-specialized mucosae, benzydamine does not often achieve the kind of absorption or blood concentrations necessary to cause any extraneous distant systemic effects or COX inhibition, allowing it to localize its action. [A31528, L1120]%0A%0AAdditionally, it is also hypothesized that benzydamine is capable of inhibiting the oxidative burst of neutrophils and membrane stabilization. These actions are exhibited by the substance’s ability to inhibit the release of granules from neutrophils and to stabilize lysosomes. [A31528, L1120]%0A%0AFurthermore, benzydamine is capable of a local anaesthetic effect that may be related to its capability for inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators like substance P and calcitonin gene related peptide from sensory nerve endings. Since substance P is capable of causing the release of histamine from mast cells, benzydamine’s prevention of substance P release further contributes to an anti-inflammatory effect. [A31528, L1120]%0A%0ABenzydamine also demonstrates a non-specific antibacterial activity against various bacterial strains that are resistant to broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline at concentrations of about 3 mmol/L. Combinatorial use of benzydamine and other antibiotics like tetracycline and chloramphenicol are also synergistic against antibiotic resistant strains of *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*.

After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid.

When dealing with Salmonella typhimurium, it has been shown that rough strains with incomplete lipopolysaccharide (LPS) lacking O-specific side chains are much less virulent than smooth strains with complete LPS with O-specific side chains [T188]. Salmonella typhimurium gal E mutants used to produce the vaccine are effectively avirulent and highly protective but lack the specific UDP-galactose 4-epimerase enzyme which allows for the normal synthesis of UDP-galactose from UDP-glucose [T188]. The consequence of this mutant defect is that the gal E mutants can only generate incomplete LPS without O-specific antigen side chains, which are not capable enough as the complete LPS with O-specific side chains at generating an immunologic response [T188]. When exogenous galactose is added to the vaccine medium, however, it allows the mutants to generate UDP-galactose via galactose 1-phosphate [T188]. This ultimately allows the mutants to form smooth-type LPS with O-specific side chains [T188]. Regardless, the mutant's epimerase defect ultimately results in the accumulation of such intermediary products like galactose 1-phosphate and UDP-galactose, which consequently causes lysis of the mutant cells. The resultant vaccine is subsequently effective enough to elicit an immunologic response while the bacteriolysis prevents the mutant cells from regaining virulence under conditions where smooth type LPS similar to the active parental strain is synthesized [T188].%0A%0AGalactose is also an essential element to the chemical structure of the commonly used laxative solution lactulose. Lactulose itself is a synthetic disaccharide that is made in parts from lactose, galactose, and various other sugars [F30]. It is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and no enzyme capable of hydrolysis of lactulose is present in human gastrointestinal tissue [F30]. Oral doses of lactulose subsequently arrive at the colon largely unchanged [F30]. At the colon, lactulose is finally broken down predominantly to lactic acid, and also small amounts of formic and acetic acids by the action of colonic bacteria, which results in an increase in osmotic pressure and slight acidification of the colonic contents [F30]. This action consequently causes an increase in stool water content and softens the stool for a laxative effect [F30].",,

Activation of alpha-2 receptors leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and reduction of cyclic AMP levels. As a result, there is a decrease in norpinephrine (NE) release at the synaptic junction, NE-induced stimulation of beta-2 adrenoceptors, and production of aqueous humor by the ciliary epithelium.[A178969] An elevated IOP is the most significant risk factor for developing glaucomatous optic neuropathy, which is associated with progressive visual field loss and functional disability if left untreated.[A179002] Regardless of the etiology of the disease, the aim of current therapies for glaucoma is to reduce IOP, as reduction of IOP significantly reduces the risk of progression of vision loss even when IOP is already within the normal range.[A36674] When administered ophthalmically, brimonidine is rapidly absorbed into the eye, acts as an agonist at ocular alpha-2 adrenoceptors and lowers IOP via a dual mechanism of action.[A178981] It is proposed that initial dosing of the drug causes a reduction in aqueous humour production and chronic dosing leads to an increase in uveoscleral outflow.[A179002] Brimonidine does not affect episcleral venous pressure.[A178969] By reducing IOP, brimonidine aims to reduce the likelihood of glaucomatous visual field loss in ocular hypertension, and slow the progression of visual field defect in established open-angle glaucoma.[A178951] When applied topically on skin, brimonidine reduces erythema through direct vasocontriction of small arteries and veins.[A178978] As brimonidine mediates a potent peripheral vasoconstrictive activity by selectively working on the alpha-2 adrenoceptors, the use of brimonidine is thought to be efficacious for the treatment of facial erythema of rosacea, which is thought to arise from vasomotor instability and abnormal vasodilation of the superficial cutaneous vasculature of the face.[A178984]",AOX1|ADRA2C|ADRA2A|ADRA2B,adrenergic receptor agonist

Amphetamine, as well as other catecholamines, is taken into presynaptic nerve terminals by the association with two sodium ions and one chloride ion. The complex of the amphetamine with the ions is actively transported by monoamine reuptake transporters. As amphetamine acts competitively with the endogenous monoamines, the greater the number of amphetamines the more internalized amphetamine will be found.[A18540]%0A%0AOnce inside the presynaptic terminal, amphetamine displaces other monoamines to be stored by VMAT2 which produces the pumping of the neurotransmitters into the synapse by a process called retro-transport.[A174211] This process of release of neurotransmitters is approximately fourfold more potent in the d-isomer for the release of dopamine.[A174214]%0A%0AThe mechanism of action of amphetamine is complemented by the inhibition of the reuptake and of monoamine oxidase which acts synergistically to produce a significant increase the monoamine concentration.[A18540] This activity is not done as an inhibitor per se but more as a competitive substrate and thus, amphetamine is known to be a weak dopamine reuptake inhibitor, moderate noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor and very weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor. From this specific action, the l-isomer is known to be significantly less potent.[A174214]%0A%0ALastly, amphetamine is known to be an inhibitor of the mitochondrial-bound enzyme MAO which is the catalytic enzyme in charge of degrading all the excess of neurotransmitters.

Mifamurtide is referred to as MTP-PE or L-MTP-PE (in case of the liposomal formulation), which is a fully synthetic derivative of muramyl dipeptide (MDP), which is a motif within the peptidoglycan polymer in the cell wall of bacteria. %0A%0AMDP stimulates the immune system by being recognized by different pattern recognition molecules and receptors, such as nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) 2 receptor and toll-like receptor (TLR). Similarly, mifamurtide acts as a ligand for TRL4 and NOD2. Involved in the innate immunity, NOD2 is an intracellular MDP sensor that is primarily expressed on monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages. It possesses an amino-terminal caspase recruitment domain, which is required to trigger nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling [A31745]. Activation of intracellular signaling transduction pathway NF-κB can promote inflammation and release of antimicrobial peptides, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and TNF-α, and other molecules such as chemokines and adhesion molecules [A31745]. Upon binding to TLR4, mifamurtide may activate extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and adaptor protein (AP)-1 [A31744]. Mifamurtide may also activate NLRP3, which is an essential component of the inflammasome, a protein complex that promotes the cleavage of procaspase 1 into its active form. Active caspase 1 further activates pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β [A31745]. Furthermore, mifamurtide induces the expression of adhesion molecules including lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1, intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR [A31744]. Mifamurtide may interact with interferon (IFN)-γ to up-regulate tumoricidal activity [A31744].%0A%0AUpon intravenous administration, lipophilic mifamurtide is selectively phagocytosed by monocytes and macrophages followed by subsequent degradation of liposomal vesicles by the phagocytic cells. Then, MTP-PE is released into the cytosol where it interacts with Nod2 and activates the macrophages and monocytes [A31744]. Mifamurtide exerts a tumoricidal action via the same signalling pathway as MDP but with greater superiority because the lipophilic properties of MTP-PE cause higher cell uptake via passive transfer through the cytoplasmic membrane [A31744]. Incorporation of MTP-PE into liposomal structures allows better safety profile and more efficient distribution to the liver, spleen, and lungs after intravenous administration [A31744].",,

Mannitol elevates blood plasma osmolality, resulting in enhanced flow of water from tissues, including the brain and cerebrospinal fluid, into interstitial fluid and plasma. As a result, cerebral edema, elevated intracranial pressure, and cerebrospinal fluid volume and pressure may be reduced. As a diurectic mannitol induces diuresis because it is not reabsorbed in the renal tubule, thereby increasing the osmolality of the glomerular filtrate, facilitating excretion of water, and inhibiting the renal tubular reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and other solutes. Mannitol promotes the urinary excretion of toxic materials and protects against nephrotoxicity by preventing the concentration of toxic substances in the tubular fluid. As an Antiglaucoma agent mannitol levates blood plasma osmolarity, resulting in enhanced flow of water from the eye into plasma and a consequent reduction in intraocular pressure. As a renal function diagnostic aid mannitol is freely filtered by the glomeruli with less than 10% tubular reabsorption. Therefore, its urinary excretion rate may serve as a measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR).|Sorbitol exerts its laxative effect by drawing water into the large intestine, thereby stimulating bowel movements.",,mucolytic agent|diuretic

This reduction in prostanoid production is the common mechanism that mediates the effects of nambutone.%0A%0APGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.%0A%0APGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.%0A%0APGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.%0A%0AThe adverse effects of NSAIDs stem from the protective and regulatory roles of prostanoids which have been well-characterized.[T116] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> regulate blood flow to the kidney by similar mechanisms to the vasodilation they produce in inflammation. Prevention of this regulation by NSAIDs produces vasoconstriction which limits renal function by reducing blood flow and the hydrostatic pressure which drives filtration. PGE<sub>2</sub> also regulates gastric protection via EP<sub>3</sub> receptors which are, in this location, coupled to G<sub>i</sub> which inhibits the AC/PKA pathway. This reduces the secretion of protons by H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase in parietal cells and increases the secretion of mucus and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> by superficial endothelial cells. Disruption of this protective action by NSAIDs lead to ulceration of the gastric mucosa. Lastly, disruption of PGI<sub>2</sub>, which opposes platelet aggregation, generation by COX-2 selective agents leads to an imbalance with TXA<sub>2</sub> generated by COX-1, which promotes aggregation of platelets, leading to increased risk of thrombosis. Since nabumetone is somewhat COX-2 selective it is thought to promote this imbalance and increase thrombotic risk.[A178903]",PTGS1|PTGS2|CYP2B6|CYP2E1|CYP2C19|AKR1C3,cyclooxygenase inhibitor

The anti-inflammatory effects of DGLA are attributed to both the anti-inflammatory properties of DGLA-derived metabolites and the ability of DGLA and its products to compete with arachidonic acid (AA) in the synthesis of pro-inflammatory potent eicosanoid products, such as prostaglandins, thromboxane and leukotrienes [A32848]. Both PGE1 and 15-HETrE are known to suppress inflammation, promote vasodilation, lower blood pressure, inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation, inhibit platelet aggregation, and exert anti-neoplastic activities [A32848]. PGE1 is a potent vasodilator that binds to surface receptors on smooth muscle cells, increasing intracellular cAMP [F27]. PGE1 is binds to G protein coupled surface PGE (EP) receptors and prostacyclin (IP) receptors as a natural ligand [A32849]. %0A%0AGLA is proposed to enhance calcium absorption, reduce excretion and increase calcium deposition in bone [A32862]. It is proposed that GLA may suppress tumor growth _in vivo_ by increasing the expression of E-cadherin, a cell-to-cell adhesion molecule that acts as a suppressor of metastasis. Another possible mechanism of tumour suppression is that GLA also reduces tumor-endothelium adhesion, which is a key factor in the establishment of distant metastases, partly by improving gap junction communication within the endothelium [A32849]. By targeting the inflammatory process involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy, GLA inhibits the expression of inflammatory mediators that tend be elevated in diabetes, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), thereby attenuates the recruitment and infiltration of monocytes or macrophages [A32850].

Ondansetron may block the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a central release of serotonin from the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle [F3178, F3181, F3184].

Pyrazinoic acid can leak out under acidic conditions to be converted to the protonated conjugate acid, which is readily diffused back into the bacilli and accumulate intracellularly. The net effect is that more pyrazinoic acid accumulates inside the bacillus at acid pH than at neutral pH. Pyrazinoic acid was thought to inhibit the enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS) I, which is required by the bacterium to synthesise fatty acids. However, this theory was thought to have been discounted.[A512] However, further studies reproduced the results of FAS I inhibition as the putative mechanism first in whole cell assay of replicating M. tuberculosis bacilli which have shown that pyrazinoic acid and its ester inhibit the synthesis of fatty acids.[A513] This study was followed by in vitro assay of tuberculous FAS I enzyme that tested the activity with pyrazinamide, pyrazinoic acid and several classes of pyrazinamide analogs. Pyrazinamide and its analogs inhibited the activity of purified FAS I.[A514] %0A%0AIt has also been suggested that the accumulation of pyrazinoic acid disrupts membrane potential and interferes with energy production, necessary for survival of M. tuberculosis at an acidic site of infection.

Energy can also be obtained anaerobically from pyruvate via its conversion to lactate. Pyruvate injections or perfusions increase contractile function of hearts when metabolizing glucose or fatty acids. This inotropic effect is striking in hearts stunned by ischemia/reperfusion. The inotropic effect of pyruvate requires intracoronary infusion. Among possible mechanisms for this effect are increased generation of ATP and an increase in ATP phosphorylation potential. Another is activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase, promoting its own oxidation by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. Pyruvate dehydrogenase is inactivated in ischemia myocardium. Yet another is reduction of cytosolic inorganic phosphate concentration. Pyruvate, as an antioxidant, is known to scavenge such reactive oxygen species as hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides.

Based on the findings of competitive binding assays, raloxifene displays binding affinity that is similar to that of [estradiol][A721], the predominant circulating estrogen.[A178861] Estrogens play variable roles at different tissues in females, including the bone, breasts, uterus and liver, by binding to the steroid nuclear hormone receptors, Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERα) or Estrogen Receptor beta (ERβ).[A178861] These receptors are normally bound to the Heat Shock Protein 90 (Hsp90) when unbound to the ligand. Ligand binding induces a conformational change in the receptor that promotes dissociation of the receptor from Hsp90, dimerization and translocation into the nucleus. This movement into the nucleus allows the receptor to bind to genomic locations based on sequence recognition of the DNA binding domain, also known as the Estrogen Response Elements (EREs).[A178861] %0A%0AIn bones, endogenous estrogens normally modulate multiple DNA response elements, including the gene-encoding transforming growth factor-β3 (TGF-β3), which is a cytokine embedded in the bone matrix.[T28] TGF-β3 plays an important role in bone remodelling[A178756] by working with other cytokines to induce production of osteoblasts, such as IL-6[A720], and attenuate the activity of osetoclasts. Estrogens typically maintain the bone integrity by inhibiting the cytokines that recruit osteoclasts and oppose the bone-resorbing, Ca2+-mobilizing action of parathyroid hormone. In contrast, estrogens promote osteoblast proliferation, augment the production of TGF-β3 and bone morphogenic proteins, and inhibit apoptosis.[T28] Mimicking the action of endogenous estrogen in bone tissues, raloxifene binds to the estrogen receptor to influence gene transcription through interactions with the estrogen response element (ERE) and a distinct DNA target, the raloxifene response element (RRE).[A722] It occupies the same ER ligand binding site as estrogen.[A724] Upon binding, raloxifene induces a conformational change of the receptor, allowing mediation of direct binding to transcriptional elements by accessory proteins. Increased expression of bone matrix proteins, such as alkaline phosphatase, osteonectin, osteocalcin and collagen may be seen.[A722] The agonistic or antagonistic action of raloxifene depends on the extent of recruitment of coactivators and corepressors to estrogen receptor (ER) target gene promotors.[label] In breast tissues, raloxifene acts as an estrogen receptor antagonist to attenuate the estrogen-dependent proliferative effects of epithelial cell expansion. In addition to the antiproliferative effects, raloxifene prevents the production of cytokines and recruitment of macrophages and lymphocytes into tumor mass.[A178921]",ESR2|ESR1|ENG|ACVRL1,estrogen receptor antagonist%7Cselective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM)

Nitric oxide then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].%0A%0ASildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum, where PDE5 is responsible for degradation of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has a peripheral site of action on erections [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum but potently enhances the relaxant effect of NO on this tissue [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. When the NO/cGMP pathway is activated, as occurs with sexual stimulation, inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil results in increased corpus cavernosum levels of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].

L-glutamine appears to play a major role in protecting the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract and, in particular, the large intestine. During catabolic states, the integrity of the intestinal mucosa may be compromised with consequent increased intestinal permeability and translocation of Gram-negative bacteria from the large intestine into the body. The demand for L-glutamine by the intestine, as well as by cells such as lymphocytes, appears to be much greater than that supplied by skeletal muscle, the major storage tissue for L-glutamine. L-glutamine is the preferred respiratory fuel for enterocytes, colonocytes and lymphocytes. Therefore, supplying supplemental L-glutamine under these conditions may do a number of things. For one, it may reverse the catabolic state by sparing skeletal muscle L-glutamine. It also may inhibit translocation of Gram-negative bacteria from the large intestine. L-glutamine helps maintain secretory IgA, which functions primarily by preventing the attachment of bacteria to mucosal cells. L-glutamine appears to be required to support the proliferation of mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes, as well as the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). It is also required for the maintenance of lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK). L-glutamine can enhance phagocytosis by neutrophils and monocytes. It can lead to an increased synthesis of glutathione in the intestine, which may also play a role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosa by ameliorating oxidative stress. The exact mechanism of the possible immunomodulatory action of supplemental L-glutamine, however, remains unclear. It is conceivable that the major effect of L-glutamine occurs at the level of the intestine. Perhaps enteral L-glutamine acts directly on intestine-associated lymphoid tissue and stimulates overall immune function by that mechanism, without passing beyond the splanchnic bed.%0A%0AThe exact mechanism of L-glutamine's effect on NAD redox potential is unknown but is thought to involve increased amounts of reduced glutathione made available by glutamine supplementation [FDA Label].

Most eicosanoids are produced by the metabolism of omega-3 fatty acids, specifically, arachidonic acid. These eicosanoids, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) stimulate leukocyte chemotaxis, platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. They are thrombogenic and artherogenic. On the other hand, EPA is metabolized to leukotriene B5 (LTB5) and thromboxane A3 (TXA3), which are eicosanoids that promote vasodilation, inhibit platelet aggregation and leukocyte chemotaxis and are anti-artherogenic and anti-thrombotic. The triglyceride-lowering effect of EPA results from inhibition of lipogenesis and stimulation of fatty acid oxidation. Fatty acid oxidation of EPA occurs mainly in the mitochondria. EPA is a substrate for Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 and 2.

It is the sodium salt of the endogenous compound  gamma hydroxybutyrate which is a metabolite of the GABA neurotransmitter and it's thought that it's therapeutic effects are mediated via GABA B actions at noradrenergic, dopaminergic and thalamocortical neurons. |GHB is present at much higher concentrations in the brain, where it activates GABA-B receptors to exert its sedative effects. With high affinity, GHB binds to excitatory GHB receptors that are densely expressed throughout the brain, including the cotex and hippocampus. There is some evidence in research that upon activation of GHB receptors in some brain areas, the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is released. GHB stimulates dopamin release at low concentrations by acting on the GHB receptor, and the release of dopamine occurs in a biphasic manner. At higher concentrations, GHB inhibits dopamine release by acting on the GABA-B receptors, which is followed by GHB receptor signaling and increased release of dopamine. This explains the paradoxical mix of sedative and stimulatory properties of GHB, as well as the so-called ""rebound"" effect, experienced by individuals using GHB as a sleeping agent, wherein they awake suddenly after several hours of GHB-induced deep sleep. It is proposed that overtime, the level of GHB in the brain decreases below the threshold for significant GABA-B receptor activation, leading to preferential activation of GHB receptor over GABA-B receptors and enhanced wakefulness.

In toothpaste and in systemic circulation, calcium phosphate provides a source of calcium and phosphate ions to support remineralization of the teeth and bone homeostasis respectively. The increase in plasma calcium reduces calcium flux from osteocyte activity by reducing the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) [T36]. Calcium does this by stimulating a G-protein coupled calcium receptor on the surface of parathyroid cells. The reduction in calcium flux increases the amount of calcium deposited in bone resulting in an increase in bone mineral density. The reduction in PTH secretion also reduces the amount of vitamin D metabolized to its active form, calcidiol. Since calcidiol increases the expression of calcium dependent ATPases and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 6 (TRPV6) both of which are involved in calcium uptake from the gut, a reduction in calcidiol results in less calcium absorption. Additionally, TRPV5, the channel responsible for calcium reabsorption in the kidney, is downregulated when PTH secretion is reduced thus increasing calcium excretion via the kidneys. Another hormone, calitonin, is likely involved in the reduction of bone resorption during periods of high plasma calcium.|Much like most calcium supplements, once calcium levulinate dissociates in the body after administration, absorption of the supplemental calcium ions across the intestinal wall serves to enhance calcium stores in the body [L2765, L2767, A33038].%0A%0ARegardless, levulinic acid (LA) is a commonly used chemical with one carbonyl group, one carboxyl group, and alpha-H comprised in its inner structure, which belongs to short-chain and non-volatile fatty acids [L2767]. Moreover, the carbon-oxygen double bond from LA's carbonyl group possesses a strong polarity, where the oxygen atom has a stronger electron attracting ability compared to the carbon atom, such that the pi electron will ultimately transfer into the greater electronegative oxygen, therefore resulting in the formation of a positive charge center in the carbon atom [L2767]. The electrophilic center of the carbon atom subsequently plays a critical role when the carbonyl group performs chemical reactions [L2767]. Owing to the relatively strong electron receptor effect of the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group, LA has higher dissociation constants than a common saturated acid, which allows it to possess a stronger corresponding acidity [L2767]. Furthermore, LA can be isomerized into the enol-isomer, owing to the presence of the carbonyl group [L2767]. The chemical structure of LA consequently has several highly active sites, which facilitates it being used as a chemical platform for preparing many other chemical products [L2767].  For example, the special structure of LA allows various kinds of products to be generated by way of esterification, halogenation, hydrogenation, oxy-dehydrogenation, and/or condensation, among many other methods [L2767].|Essential for nervous, muscular, and skeletal systems.

Lactic acid is a naturally-occurring compound that serves as fuel or energy in mammals by acting as an ubiquitous intermediate in the metabolic pathways [F59]. Lactic acid diffuses through the muscles and is transported to the liver by the bloodstream to participate in gluconeogenesis [F59]. |Calcium is essential for the functional integrity of the nervous, muscular, and skeletal systems.

Since the metabolic functions of calcium are essential for life, when there is a disturbance in the calcium balance because of dietary deficiency or other causes, the stores of calcium in bone may be depleted to fill the body's more acute needs.

In toothpaste and in systemic circulation, calcium phosphate provides a source of calcium and phosphate ions to support remineralization of the teeth and bone homeostasis respectively. The increase in plasma calcium reduces calcium flux from osteocyte activity by reducing the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) [T36]. Calcium does this by stimulating a G-protein coupled calcium receptor on the surface of parathyroid cells. The reduction in calcium flux increases the amount of calcium deposited in bone resulting in an increase in bone mineral density. The reduction in PTH secretion also reduces the amount of vitamin D metabolized to its active form, calcidiol. Since calcidiol increases the expression of calcium dependent ATPases and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 6 (TRPV6) both of which are involved in calcium uptake from the gut, a reduction in calcidiol results in less calcium absorption. Additionally, TRPV5, the channel responsible for calcium reabsorption in the kidney, is downregulated when PTH secretion is reduced thus increasing calcium excretion via the kidneys. Another hormone, calitonin, is likely involved in the reduction of bone resorption during periods of high plasma calcium.|Much like most calcium supplements, once calcium levulinate dissociates in the body after administration, absorption of the supplemental calcium ions across the intestinal wall serves to enhance calcium stores in the body [L2765, L2767, A33038].%0A%0ARegardless, levulinic acid (LA) is a commonly used chemical with one carbonyl group, one carboxyl group, and alpha-H comprised in its inner structure, which belongs to short-chain and non-volatile fatty acids [L2767]. Moreover, the carbon-oxygen double bond from LA's carbonyl group possesses a strong polarity, where the oxygen atom has a stronger electron attracting ability compared to the carbon atom, such that the pi electron will ultimately transfer into the greater electronegative oxygen, therefore resulting in the formation of a positive charge center in the carbon atom [L2767]. The electrophilic center of the carbon atom subsequently plays a critical role when the carbonyl group performs chemical reactions [L2767]. Owing to the relatively strong electron receptor effect of the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group, LA has higher dissociation constants than a common saturated acid, which allows it to possess a stronger corresponding acidity [L2767]. Furthermore, LA can be isomerized into the enol-isomer, owing to the presence of the carbonyl group [L2767]. The chemical structure of LA consequently has several highly active sites, which facilitates it being used as a chemical platform for preparing many other chemical products [L2767].  For example, the special structure of LA allows various kinds of products to be generated by way of esterification, halogenation, hydrogenation, oxy-dehydrogenation, and/or condensation, among many other methods [L2767].|Essential for nervous, muscular, and skeletal systems. Maintain cell membrane and capillary permeability. Act as an activator in the transmission of nerve impulses and contraction of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle. Essential for bone formation and blood coagulation.|In aqueous environments such as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, calcium lactate will dissociate into calcium cation and lactic acid anions, the conjugate base of lactic acid. Lactic acid is a naturally-occurring compound that serves as fuel or energy in mammals by acting as an ubiquitous intermediate in the metabolic pathways [F59]. Lactic acid diffuses through the muscles and is transported to the liver by the bloodstream to participate in gluconeogenesis [F59]. |Calcium is essential for the functional integrity of the nervous, muscular, and skeletal systems. It plays a role in normal cardiac function, renal function, respiration, blood coagulation, and cell membrane and capillary permeability. Also, calcium helps to regulate the release and storage of neurotransmitters and hormones, the uptake and binding of amino acids, absorption of vitamin B 12, and gastrin secretion. The major fraction (99%) of calcium is in the skeletal structure primarily as hydroxyapatite, Ca 10(PO 4) 6(OH) 2; small amounts of calcium carbonate and amorphous calcium phosphates are also present. The calcium of bone is in a constant exchange with the calcium of plasma. Since the metabolic functions of calcium are essential for life, when there is a disturbance in the calcium balance because of dietary deficiency or other causes, the stores of calcium in bone may be depleted to fill the body's more acute needs. Therefore, on a chronic basis, normal mineralization of bone depends on adequate amounts of total body calcium. |Once dissociated to calcium and L-theronic acid, L-threonic acid exhibits significant stimulatory action on vitamin C uptake and prolongs the retention of vitamin C in human T-lymphoma cells [A27266]. Vitamin C is a marker for osteoblast formation and has been shown to stimulate procollagen and enhance collagen synthesis [A27266]. Via stimulation of vitamin C uptake, L-threonic acid acts as a metabolite that influences the mineralization process [A27266]. |Calcium citrate increases plasma calcium levels.

Approximately 90% of calcium chloride is converted to insoluble calcium salts (e.g. calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate).%0A|Calcium plays a vital role in the anatomy, physiology and biochemistry of organisms and of the cell, particularly in signal transduction pathways. More than 500 human proteins are known to bind or transport calcium.   The skeleton acts as a major mineral storage site for the element and releases Ca2+ ions into the bloodstream under controlled conditions. Circulating calcium is either in the free, ionized form or bound to blood proteins such as serum albumin. Parathyroid hormone (secreted from the parathyroid gland) regulates the resorption of Ca2+ from bone. Calcitonin stimulates incorporation of calcium in bone, although this process is largely independent of calcitonin. Although calcium flow to and from the bone is neutral, about 5 mmol is turned over a day. Bone serves as an important storage point for calcium, as it contains 99% of the total body calcium.

The efficacy of stannous fluoride solutions seems to depend mainly on the incorporation of tin in the mineralized dentine when the organic portion is preserved but on surface precipitation when the organic portion is continuously digested. Moreover, the relative erosion-inhibiting effects of stannous fluoride strongly depend on the presence or absence of the demineralized organic dentine matrix [A19596].",,

Furthermore, epothilone B has also been shown to induce tubulin polymerization into microtubules without the presence of GTP. This is caused by formation of microtubule bundles throughout the cytoplasm. Finally, epothilone B also causes cell cycle arrest at the G2-M transition phase, thus leading to cytotoxicity and eventually cell apoptosis.",TUBB4A|TUBB4B|TUBA4A|TUBA3C|TUBA1B|TUBA1C|TUBA1A|TUBA8|TUBB3|TUBB1|TUBB,microtubule stabilizing agent%7Ctubulin polymerization inhibitor

Activation of this system upon stimulation by different factors, such as low blood pressure and nerve impulses, leads to increased release of norepinephrine (NE) from sympathetic nerve terminals and effects on the vascular growth, vasoconstriction, and salt retention in the kidneys.[T28] Renin is released from %0ARenin acts on the precursor prottein angiotensinogen, which is a plasma globulin synthesized from the liver, to produce cleaved peptide hormone angiotensin I.[T28] Angiotensin I then can be further cleaved by ACE to produce angiotensin II, a vasoconstrictive peptide hormone.[label] Present in different isoforms, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is peptidyl dipeptidase enzyme expressed in various tissues, including the vascular tissues, such as the heart, brain, and kidneys.[T28] ACE also plays a role in inactivation of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide.[T28,label] Angiotensin II mediates various actions on the body by working on its G-protein coupled receptors, AT1 and AT2.[T28] It causes direct vasoconstriction of precapillary arterioles and postcapillary venules, inhibits the reuptake of NE thereby increasing available levels, stimulates the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla, reduces urinary excretion of sodium ions and water by promoting proximal tubular reabsorption, stimulates synthesis and release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, and stimulates hypertrophy of both vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes.[L6619]%0A%0AEnalapril is a pharmacologically inactive prodrug that requires hepatic biotransformation to form [enalaprilat], its active metabolite that works on the RAAS to inhibit ACE.[label] Biotransformation is critial for the therapeutic actions of the drug, as enalapril itself is only a weak inhibitor of ACE.[A179131] ACE inhibition results in reduced production and plasma levels of angiotensin II, increased plasma renin activity due to the loss of feedback inhibition by angiotensin II, and decreased aldosterone secretion.[L6586] However, plasma aldosterone levels usually return to normal during long-term administration of enalapril.[A179140] Decreased levels of angiotensin II subsequently leads to the dilatation of peripheral vessles and reduced vascular resistance which in turn lower blood pressure.[A179140] While inhibition of ACE leading to suppression of RAAS is thought to be the primary mechanism of action of enalapril, the drug was shown to still exert antihypertensive effects on individuals with low-renin hypertension. It is suggested that enalapril may mediate its pharmacological actions via other modes of action that are not fully understood.[label] As ACE is structurally similar to kininase I, which is a carboxypeptidase that degrades bradykinin, whether increased levels of bradykinin play a role in the therapeutic effects of enalapril remains to be elucidated.[label]|Enalaprilat is the active metabolite of the orally available pro-drug, enalapril. Used in the treatment of hypertension, enalapril is an ACE inhibitor that prevents Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) from transforming angiotensin I into angiotensin II. As angiotensin II is responsible for vasoconstriction and sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule of the kidney, down-regulation of this protein results in reduced blood pressure and blood fluid volume",ACE,angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor

Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function.
